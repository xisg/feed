Enumerating the strings of regular languages

Abstract

Haskell code is developed for two ways to list the strings of the language deﬁned by a regular expression: directly by set operations and indirectly by converting to and simulating an equivalent automaton. The exercise illustrates techniques for dealing with inﬁnite ordered domains and leads to an eﬀective standard form for nondeterministic ﬁnite automata.

Lazy languages are well suited to sequence generation because of the ease with which they handle inﬁnite sequences. The problem of enumerating the strings of a regular language was proposed by Jay Misra as a lovely case in point, simple to state, yet tricky to solve. This paper develops two concise and radically diﬀerent solutions in Haskell (Peterson et al., 1998), one direct and one indirect. Both approaches exploit Haskell’s outstanding ﬁtness for structural induction. The direct approach interprets regular expressions as recipes for building sets. Here the main concern is programming the primitives for combining sets: union, cross-product, and closure under a binary operation. The primitives apply to any well ordered domain. The indirect approach detours through automata, ﬁrst constructing an equivalent nondeterministic ﬁnite automaton, then tracing execution paths of the automaton in breadth-ﬁrst order. The automata have an unusual shape: besides a single ﬁnal state, there is exactly one state per symbol in the regular expression and that state accepts only the one symbol. The set operations developed for the ﬁrst solution are used again, this time for combining sets of states rather than sets of strings. Working Haskell code is available electronically. (McIlroy, 2003)

1 The problem

Devise a program to enumerate the distinct strings of the regular language denoted by a given regular expression. The resulting list should be ordered by string length and lexicographically within each length. Parsing is not at issue; regular expressions are taken to be already parsed data structures.

1.1 Terminology

A regular expression denotes a language (or set) of strings over an ordered alphabet A. Table 1 deﬁnes how a regular expression e and its language L(e) may be constructed. The operators (Kleene closure, catenation, alternation) are listed in decreasing order of precedence, subject as usual to explicit grouping by parentheses. The catenation of two languages is the set of pairwise catenations of strings from each. The Kleene closure of a language is the set of strings made by catenating zero or more (not necessarily distinct) strings from the language. Phrases such as ‘enumerating the strings of a language’ will usually be shortened to ‘enumerating a language’, and ‘enumerating the strings of the language deﬁned by ...’ to ‘enumerating the language of ...’. Two languages will be used as running examples.

Example 1, sandwich language

Regular expression ab*a denotes possibly empty strings of b’s sandwiched between single a’s: ["aa", "aba", "abba", "abbba", ... ]

Example 2, even-a language

Regular expression (ab*a|b)* denotes strings that contain an even number of a’s and any number of b’s:

["aa", "aab", "aba", "baa", "aaaa", "aabb", "abab", "abba", "baab", "baba", "bbaa", "bbbb", ... ]

2 Length-ordered lists

Length-ordered strings, LOS, are deﬁned as a special case of a polymorphic lengthordered list data type, LOL.

data LOL a = LOL [a] deriving Eq instance Ord a => Ord (LOL a) where LOL x <= LOL y = (length x, x) <= (length y, y) type LOS = LOL Char

Equality tests are automatically lifted from lists to length-ordered lists by the deriving clause. Inequality tests are implemented by placing length ordered lists over an ordered type a in type class Ord and stating that comparison is done ﬁrst on length, then content. To deﬁne catenation of length-ordered lists, they are placed in class MonadPlus, to which the ++ operator belongs, and the constructor LOL is declared to distribute across catenation. As a technical detail, membership in MonadPlus requires membership in superclasses MonadZero and Monad.

instance MonadPlus LOL where (LOL x) ++ (LOL y) = LOL (x++y) instance MonadZero LOL instance Monad LOL

3 Set operations

According to the usual head-tail strategy for stream processing, operators to calculate new ordered sets from old ones will explicitly calculate the head (least) element of an output and recur to calculate the tail (greater) elements. These operators apply to strictly ordered lists of distinct elements.

3.1 Union

Set union is denoted by inﬁx \/, left associative, with the same precedence (6) as addition. The operation is carried out by a conventional merge, using Haskell’s 3-way comparison function.

infixl 6 \/ (\/) :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a] [] \/ ys = ys xs \/ [] = xs xs@(x:xt) \/ ys@(y:yt) = case compare x y of LT -> x : xt\/ys EQ -> x : xt\/yt GT -> y : xs\/yt

(According to custom, sequence variables are suﬃxed with s. When both a sequence and its tail are named, the latter is given suﬃx t.) Other binary operations on sets,

4 M. D. McIlroy

such as intersection, diﬀerence and symmetric diﬀerence, would be programmed similarly.

Example 3 These expressions all evaluate to True.

[1,3,4] \/ [1,2,4,7] == [1,2,3,4,7] ["a", "aab"] \/ ["b", "bb"] == ["a", "aab", "b", "bb"] [LOL "a", LOL "aab"] \/ [LOL "b", LOL "bb"] == [LOL "a", LOL "b", LOL "bb", LOL "aab"]

Example 4. The expression [0,2..] \/ [1,3..] == [1..]

though true, involves inﬁnitely many comparisons; its evaluation will not terminate.

3.2 Cross product and set catenation

To catenate sets, we must generate an ordered list of strings xy for all pairs (x, y) in the cross product of two sets. The least string of the result is the catenation of the least strings of the two sets. Catenation of length-ordered lists is monotone in both arguments: x < x′ implies xy < x′y for all y and yx < yx′ for all ﬁnite y. Other familiar binary functions have the same property: addition of nonnegative integers, multiplication of positive integers, and pairing of nonnegative integers in the Cantor order, where pairs (i, j) are ordered ﬁrst on i+j and then on i. It should be useful, then, to make a polymorphic cross-product generator with a functional argument:

xprod :: (Ord a, Ord b, Ord c) => (a->b->c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]

Example 5 These expressions evaluate to True:

xprod (+) [1,3,5] [2,4,5] == [3,5,6,7,8,9,10] xprod (++) ["","a"] ["ab", "b"] == ["ab","aab","b"] xprod (++) [LOL "", LOL "a"] [LOL "b", LOL "ab"] == [LOL "b", LOL "ab", LOL "aab"] xprod (^) [2,3,4] [1,2] == [2,3,4,9,16] (xprod pair [1,2] [1,2] == [(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)]) where pair x y = (x,y)]

The function xprod can work, in the sense that every element of the cross product eventually appears, only if the output domain is well ordered, i.e. has no element with an inﬁnite number of predecessors. Length-ordered lists are well ordered.

Functional pearls 5

Example 6 The last expression in Example 5 does not generalize to inﬁnite lists. The expression

(xprod pair [1..] [1..]) where pair x y = (x,y)

fails to produce a full mathematical cross product, because Haskell’s standard (lexicographic) ordering on pairs is not a well ordering. The expression evaluates to

[(1,1),(1,2),(1,3), ...]

which contains no pair with ﬁrst member greater than 1.

The basic pattern of xprod applied to nonempty sets must be

xprod f (x:xt) (y:yt) = f x y : tail

The tail may be decomposed into two sets of pairings: (1) x paired with everything in yt, and (2) everything in xt paired with everything in (y:yt). The two sets may be constructed recursively and then unioned to give the tail.

xprod _ [] _ = [] xprod _ _ [] = [] xprod f (x:xt) ys@(y:yt) = (f x y) : (xprod f [x] yt) \/ (xprod f xt ys)

Catenation of regular languages, represented as length-ordered lists of strings, is a specialization.

cat :: [LOS] -> [LOS] -> [LOS] cat = xprod (++)

3.3 Closure

The Kleene closure, x∗, of a set x of strings is the closure of x under catenation, i.e. x∗is the least ﬁxed point k of k = ϵ | xk. Again we generalize. The set x of strings becomes a set from a well ordered domain; catenation becomes a semigroup operation f on the domain, monotone in both arguments; and ϵ becomes the identity element z for operation f. Moreover, z must be the least element of the domain.

closure :: Ord a => (a->a->a) -> a -> [a] -> [a] closure f z [] = [z] closure f z xs@(x:xt) = if x==z then closure f z xt else z : xprod f xs (closure f z xs)

This deﬁnition of closure works, despite the seemingly circular call in the else clause, because the cons constructor (:) assures a lag; each new element in the result depends only on previously computed elements. The critical then clause deletes the identity element from xs, thereby preventing output elements from reappearing by combination with the identity. The deletion causes nothing to be omitted from the cross product.

data Rexp = Nil -- empty language | Eps -- empty string | Sym Char -- symbol of the alphabet | Clo Rexp -- Kleene closure | Cat Rexp Rexp -- catenation | Alt Rexp Rexp -- alternation

enumR :: Rexp -> [String] enumR r = [x | (LOL x) <- enumR’ r]

enumR’ :: Rexp -> [LOS] enumR’ Nil = [] enumR’ Eps = [LOL ""] enumR’ (Sym a) = [LOL [a]] enumR’ (Clo x) = clo (enumR’ x) enumR’ (Cat x y) = cat (enumR’ x) (enumR’ y) enumR’ (Alt x y) = alt (enumR’ x) (enumR’ y)

alt :: [LOS] -> [LOS] -> [LOS] alt = (\/)

Fig. 1. Direct enumeration of regular languages

Kleene closure, clo, is a specialization, in which the operation is catenation and the identity element is the (length-ordered) empty string.

clo :: [LOS] -> [LOS] clo = closure (++) (LOL "")

4 Direct enumeration

Given the set operations, it is easy to enumerate a language directly from its deﬁning regular expression. Table 1 maps directly into the data deﬁnition in Figure 1, where a straightforward program enumR’ constructs a list of length-ordered strings, using set operations. A wrapper program, enumR, strips away the LOL constructors to give a list of plain strings.

Example 7 The sandwich and even-a languages, ab*a and (ab*a|b)*, are deﬁned by

a = Sym ’a’ b = Sym ’b’ sandwich = Cat a (Cat (Clo b) a) even_a = Clo (Alt sandwich b)

and the even-a language is enumerated by

enumR even_a

Functional pearls 7

5 A path through automata

Automata theory oﬀers a radically diﬀerent approach to enumerating regular languages. A nondeterministic ﬁnite automaton (NFA) is a convenient equivalent to a regular expression, with a state count roughly linear in the length of the expression. (Equivalent deterministic automata can be exponentially larger.) We shall convert regular expressions to nondeterministic automata (Perrin, 1990) of a particularly simple form, with these properties:

• There is one ﬁnal state. • There is also one state for each occurrence of a symbol in the regular expression. • One or more states are start states, unless the automaton is empty. • Each nonﬁnal state accepts just one symbol. • There are no epsilon moves; the input tape moves with every state change.

Example 8 The automaton for the even-a language (ab*a|b)* has 5 states: a ﬁnal state and one state for each occurrence of symbols a and b.

An automaton is known by its start states. A state is fully described by a distinguishing identiﬁer, the symbol it accepts, and the states it moves to on that symbol. ‘The states it moves to’ may equally well be thought of as ‘the new automaton it becomes’. We take state identiﬁers to be nonnegative integers, with 0 identifying the ﬁnal state.

type NFA = [State] data State = State Ident Char NFA type Ident = Int

Example 9 The sandwich language ab*a is deﬁned by automaton g, whose only start state is g3.

g0 = State 0 ’~’ [] g1 = State 1 ’a’ [g0] g2 = State 2 ’b’ [g1,g2] g3 = State 3 ’a’ [g1,g2] g = [g3]

States in g are numbered from right to left in the regular expression. The ﬁnal state’s symbol, ~, is a dummy, unusable because there are no moves from that state.

Example 10 The even-a language (ab*a|b)* is deﬁned by automaton h, with three start states.

h0 = State 0 ’~’ [] h1 = State 1 ’b’ [h4,h1,h0] h2 = State 2 ’a’ [h4,h1,h0]

8 M. D. McIlroy

h3 = State 3 ’b’ [h2,h3] h4 = State 4 ’a’ [h2,h3] h = [h4,h1,h0]

5.1 Terminology

The pedantic distinction between a regular expression and its equivalent automaton may be dropped when the meaning is clear from context. An automaton e whose language L(e) contains ϵ is called bypassable. b(e) is a predicate, true if and only if e is bypassable. S(e) denotes the set of start states of automaton e. F(e) denotes the set of ﬁrst states, start states of e that are distinct from the ﬁnal state. The language of e started in F(e) is L(e) −ϵ. D(e) denotes destination states, states that are outside automaton e and are reached by notional epsilon moves from the ﬁnal state of e. The notional epsilon moves are subsumed by replacing each move to the ﬁnal state with a set of moves to the destination states. The ﬁnal state of any subautomaton is also notional; it is never represented in any data structure. A set of constituent equations relates the attributes b(e), S(e), F(e) and D(e) of a composed automaton e and of any immediate components, e1 or e2. Destination states of a bypassable automaton also appear among the start states according to the constituent equations

S(e) = F(e) ∪D(e), if b(e) is true S(e) = F(e), if b(e) is false

Example 11 Automaton h (Example 10) has two ﬁrst states, h4 for the ﬁrst a in (ab*a|b)* and h1 for the second b. Being a closure, which can match the empty string, the body of the automaton is bypassable. Thus the start states include the ﬁrst states and the sole destination state, ﬁnal state h0.

5.2 NFA construction

We shall deﬁne a function r2n to convert a regular expression to a nondeterministic automaton.

r2n :: Rexp -> NFA

The main work of conversion, though, will be done by an auxiliary function r2n’, which constructs automata for subexpressions and connects them according to the recipes below. The parameters of r2n’ are a subexpression (type Rexp), the least identiﬁer (Ident) available for any states that may have to be created, and the destination states (NFA). The return value comprises the ﬁrst states (NFA), the next available identiﬁer (Ident) for use in further subautomata, and a bypass ﬂag (Bool), true if and only if the newly constructed automaton is bypassable.

Functional pearls 9

r2n’ :: Rexp -> Ident -> NFA -> (NFA,Ident,Bool)

Example 12 Consider the subexpression that consists of the ﬁrst b in (ab*a|b)*. The corresponding subautomaton, h3 in Example 10, is built by the code fragment

(fs,n,bf) = r2n’ (Sym ’b’) 3 ([h2]\/fs)

which is invoked in the course of constructing the automaton for the immediately enclosing subexpression b*. State identiﬁer 3 is the ﬁrst identiﬁer that the new subautomaton can use. State h2, which accepts the second a in (ab*a|b)*, is the only destination state outside of the surrounding b*. The full destination argument, ([h2]\/fs), says the subautomaton for b in context may also loop back to its own ﬁrst states fs; lazy evaluation closes the loop. The new available-identiﬁer value, n, will be 4 because the subautomaton uses one state, state 3. The bypass ﬂag bf will be False because b cannot match the empty string.

The top-level conversion program, r2n, constructs the ﬁnal state (State 0 ’~’ []). and calls r2n’ to construct the rest of automaton r. State 0 is the sole member of the automaton’s destination states ds, and 1 is the next available state identiﬁer. The start states returned by r2n include the ﬁrst states and, conditionally, the destination states (the singleton ﬁnal state), as determined by a bypass function bp, depending on the bypass ﬂag b.

r2n r = let { ds = [State 0 ’~’ []]; (fs, _, b) = r2n’ r 1 ds } in fs \/ (bp b ds)

bp :: Bool -> NFA -> NFA bp True ds = ds bp False _ = []

Since operator \/ works only on ordered sets, we must place an order on states. Though any ordering, such as ordering by identiﬁer, might do, we shall see later that ordering by state symbol is more convenient for the task at hand.

5.2.1 Primitive automata

The constructions for primitive regular expressions e are straightforward. Each is described below, together with constituent equations and Haskell code. If e is ∅, the automaton is nugatory. It has no states and is not bypassable.

F(e) = ∅ b(e) = false

r2n’ Nil n _ = ([], n, False)

If e is ϵ, the automaton also has no states; it is a pure bypass.

F(e) = ∅ b(e) = true

10 M. D. McIlroy

r2n’ Eps n _ = ([], n, True)

If e is (Sym c), the automaton has one state, which accepts symbol c; it is not bypassable. Its identiﬁer is n; the next available identiﬁer is n+1. The state’s moves go to the destination states ds.

F(e) = {state n} b(e) = true

r2n’ (Sym c) n ds = ([State n c ds], n+1, False)

5.2.2 Composed automata

In an alternation, e = e1 | e2, the destination states of e1 and e2 are the destination states of e. The ﬁrst states of e are the union of the ﬁrst states of e1 and e2. The alternation is bypassable if either e1 or e2 is bypassable.

D(e1) = D(e2) = D(e) F(e) = F(e1) ∪F(e2) b(e) = b(e1) ∨b(e2)

r2n’ (Alt x y) n ds = let { (fs, n’, b) = r2n’ y n ds; (fs’, n’’, b’) = r2n’ x n’ ds; } in (fs\/fs’, n’’, b||b’)

In a catenation, e = e1e2, the destination states of e2 are the destination states of e. The destination states of e1 are the start states of e2. The ﬁrst states of the catenation are the ﬁrst states of e1 plus, if e1 is bypassable, the ﬁrst states of e2. The catenation is bypassable if both e1 and e2 are bypassable.

D(e2) = D(e) D(e1) = S(e2) b(e) = b(e1) ∧b(e2) F(e) = F(e1) ∪F(e2), if b(e1) is true F(e) = F(e1), if b(e1) is false

r2n’ (Cat x y) n ds = let { (fs, n’, b) = r2n’ y n ds; (fs’, n’’, b’) = r2n’ x n’ (fs\/(bp b ds)); } in (fs’\/(bp b’ fs), n’’, b&&b’)

The ﬁrst states of a closure, e = e∗ 1, are the ﬁrst states of e1. The destination states of e1 are the union of the ﬁrst states of e1 and the destination states of e The closure is bypassable.

F(e) = F(e1) D(e1) = D(e) ∪F(e1) b(e) = true

Functional pearls 11

r2n’ (Clo x) n ds = let { (fs, n’, _) = r2n’ x n (fs\/ds) } in (fs, n’, True)

Example 13 The automata in Examples 9 and 10 are exactly the automata that r2n builds for the regular expressions of Example 7.

g = r2n sandwich h = r2n even_a

5.2.3 Suﬃciency of lazy evaluation

Inspection of the constituent equations reveals that the following computation schedule imposes an order of evaluation wherein the left side of each equation may be calculated from the right. The existence of a feasible schedule assures us that lazy evaluation of r2n’ will solve the constituent equations.

1. Initialize D(e) at the root of the regular expression tree, from r2n. 2. Initialize b(.) and F(.) at the leaves, from formulas for primitive automata. 3. Compute b(.) by a postorder traversal of the regular expression tree. 4. Compute F(.) by a postorder traversal. 5. Compute D(.) and S(.) by a preorder traversal that computes D(e) before S(e) and visits e2 before e1 whenever both exist.

5.2.4 Complexity

Let a regular expression r contain s symbols (s+1 states); let its parse tree contain n nodes; and let time be measured in Haskell interpreter steps, exclusive of compilation and garbage collection. Then the set operations in r2n’ take worst-case time O(s + 1) per node for which they are called. Since r2n’ is called once per node, the construction takes time at most O((s + 1)n), or O(n2) in view of the fact that s ≤n. This complexity is asymptotically optimal, witness the family of regular expressions

a∗ 1a∗ 2...a∗ n,

where the ai are distinct. Minimal automata for these expressions have move tables with O(n2) entries.

5.3 Enumerating the language of an NFA

To enumerate the language of an automaton, we simulate its operation. Each step of the simulation treats the automaton’s action in a set of states to which the automaton has been driven by a distinct string. The history to that point is summarized in a word that tells the string and the current states.

12 M. D. McIlroy

type Word = (String,NFA)

In each state the automaton accepts one symbol and moves to another set of states. Since diﬀerent states may have diﬀerent symbols, each word in general gives rise to multiple words, the strings of which diﬀer in their last symbols. Thus the words form a tree rooted at a start word (string is empty, current states are the start states). A word’s depth in the tree is the same as the length of its string. If a word’s states include the ﬁnal state (0), the word’s string is accepted by the automaton.

accept :: NFA -> Bool accept ds = 0 ‘elem‘ [i | (State i _ _) <- ds]

To produce strings ordered by length, we must walk the tree of words breadth ﬁrst. Thus we are led to keep a queue ws of words.

visit :: [Word] -> [String] visit [] = [] visit ((x,ds):ws) = let { xs = visit (ws ++ ...) } in if accept ds then x:xs else xs

The current word (x,ds) is removed from the queue and a set of successor words (...) is constructed and appended to the queue. If the current states indicate acceptance, the word’s string is placed on the output list. The rest of the list, xs, is computed by recursively visiting other words in the queue. To avoid getting duplicate strings among the successor words, we group the moves from all the states in ds by symbol. For convenience we represent a group by a (possibly ﬁctitious) state that accepts the symbol and has a unioned list of moves. The code for the grouping function

grp :: NFA -> NFA

will be given later. The set of successors to word (x,ds) is

[(x++[c],ds’) | (State _ c ds’) <- grp ds]

Whence the completed code for visit is

visit [] = [] visit ((x,ds):ws) = let { xs = visit (ws ++ [(x++[c],ds’) | (State _ c ds’) <- grp ds]) } in if accept ds then x:xs else xs

If the grouped states are ordered by symbol, words with strings x++[c] will be added to the queue in lexicographic order. To facilitate grouping, it is convenient to keep lists of states ordered by symbol, resolved when necessary by identiﬁer. That ordering is deﬁned by

instance Eq State where (State i _ _) == (State i’ _ _) = i==i’ instance Ord State where (State i c _) <= (State i’ c’ _) = (c,i) <= (c’,i’)

Functional pearls 13

Now, to enumerate the language of an automaton known by its start states starts, we initialize the visiting process at the root of the tree, with the automaton setting out from its start states to consider and extend the empty word.

enumA :: NFA -> [String] enumA starts = visit [("",starts)]

Words will be visited in length-ﬁrst order. To prove this, observe that if words of length n occur consecutively in the queue (as holds trivially for n = 0), then their successors of length n + 1 will occur consecutively further on in the queue. Moreover, if all words x of length n are lexicographically ordered (again trivially true for n = 0), the successor strings x++[c] will be, too, because the c’s come in order. We must still provide code for grp, which represents the union of moves of states that have the same symbol as the moves of ﬁctitious states, all harmlessly given the same identiﬁer, −1. Every list of states, having been constructed by set operations, is necessarily ordered, and states are ordered by symbol. Thus grp need only run along the list of states, consolidating adjacent states that have a common symbol c.

grp :: NFA -> NFA grp (m@(State _ c ds) : ms@((State _ c’ ds’):mt)) = if c==c’ then grp ((State (-1) c (ds\/ds’)):mt) else m : grp ms grp ms = ms -- 0- and 1-element lists

While the foregoing code is complete, in the sense that it does eventually list each string of a language, it can run forever considering dead-end ‘preﬁxes’ for an empty language denoted by a regular expression such as a∗∅. This bad behavior may be forestalled by preprocessing to eliminate ∅from all but the top level of a regular expression. A function to do so, deNil, is included in the working code (McIlroy, 2003). A robust enumerator enumRA of the language of a regular expression may be composed from deNil, r2n and enumA.

deNil :: Rexp -> Rexp enumRA :: Rexp -> [String] enumRA = enumA . r2n . deNil

Example 14 The Haskell expression

enumRA sandwich

enumerates the sandwich language (Example 7).

5.4 Testing

A good test of both of the very diﬀerent programs enumR and enumRA is aﬀorded by two-version programming. Although Haskell cannot conﬁrm equality of inﬁnite

14 M. D. McIlroy

lists, it can check arbitrary initial segments. Agreement on a long initial stretch is good evidence for the correctness of the two enumerators.1

To look for pathological cases, the comparative check was run on exhaustive enumerations of expressions of limited size, using the Hugs(1998) interpreter. The most extensive test checked thirty strings for each of the 182,712 expressions free of ∅and ϵ on a two-letter alphabet, with operators nested at most three deep. This test, including the generation of regular expressions, used one billion reductions, two billion cells, 23000 garbage collections, and 30 CPU minutes on a 400 MHz Pentium with Hugs’s default 100K workspace. The exhaustive lists of expressions with operator nesting depth at most d were created by specifying an ordering and using set operations.

rexprs 0 = [Sym ’a’, Sym ’b’] rexprs d = let rs = rexprs (d-1) in rs \/ xprod Cat rs rs \/ xprod Alt rs rs \/ map Clo rs

Another test, of the 90276 regular expressions having eight or fewer Rexp nodes, on two alphabetic symbols plus ∅and ϵ, used 800 million reductions, 1.5 billion cells, 20000 garbage collections, and 25 CPU minutes.

6 Discussion

6.1 Eﬃciency

The direct enumerator enumR can waste time generating every parsing of a string and discarding all but one. Moreover, the time per comparison to identify duplicates grows with string length.

Example 16 Length-n strings in the language a∗a∗have n + 1 diﬀerent parsings: aian−i, for i = 0..n. The direct enumerator makes n + 1 copies of a and rejects all but one as duplicates. By catenating k instances of a∗we can make the number of comparisons per string of length n grow as nk−1.

By contrast, an automaton generates each word just once. It may be shown that an automaton built from a ∅-free regular expression considers O(m) words in generating the ﬁrst m strings of the language, and does a bounded amount of work per word considered. Thus each such automaton does work asymptotically proportional to the number of language strings enumerated. Still, the work per string can be large, depending on the regular expression. For some regular expressions direct generation is faster.

1 A plausible, but usually wildly pessimistic, estimate of how far to check follows from setting the goal of exercising every distinct superstate (set of current states) of the NFA. As the number of superstates is at most 2s+1, where s is the number of symbols in the regular expression, a correct implementation is sure to visit every superstate in the course of listing strings up to length 2s+1.

Functional pearls 15

6.2 Fictitious states

The ﬁctitious states constructed in the course of visiting a word are closely related to an equivalent deterministic automaton. A word’s current-state set, or superstate, may be identiﬁed with a state of the deterministic automaton. The ﬁctitious states describe superstates and their transitions. By caching distinct ﬁctitious states, one could build the equivalent deterministic automaton in the course of simulating the NFA.2

6.3 The automata

Recognizers based on nondeterministic automata in the one-state-per-symbol form are extremely simple to simulate. The execution cycle is

1. Check whether any current state is ﬁnal. 2. Replace the set of current states by the union of next states for every current state that accepts the next input character. 3. Advance the input.

The construction method descends from Ken Thompson’s classic construction.(1968) The present method diﬀers from the earlier construction and derivatives thereof (Aho et al., 1986; Thompson, 2000) in dispensing with epsilon moves. Epsilon moves do not appear as either transitory or permanent artifacts of the construction process. There is no separate transitive-closure calculation to remove them, and no capability to simulate them. Only the tiny function bp remains as a Cheshire grin of epsilons past.

6.4 Paean to Haskell

The art of handling regular expressions and automata is ancient; I have simply dressed the subject in modern garb. Functional programming in general (Harper, 1999), and Haskell in particular (Thompson, 2000) oﬀer eminently suitable fabric. In developing the automata-based code, I set out guided by the classic models. (Thompson, 1968; Aho et al., 1986) Then the Haskell formulation revealed an opportunity: lazy evaluation allowed separate states that represented composed subexpressions and associated epsilon moves to be elided prospectively. Having found the Haskell version, I could now write the program comfortably in most any language. But if the exercise had begun in a traditional language, the ﬁnal neat model would not have been perceived.

2 This hypothetical way to build a deterministic automaton echos the eminently practical lazy construction strategy pioneered by Aho in the Unix pattern-matching program “egrep”: construct a state of a deterministic automaton only when a string that drives the automaton to that state is met.

This work reﬂects the inﬂuence of members of IFIP Working Group 2.3, Programming Methodology. In particular Jay Misra proposed the problem, provided the elegant one-line deﬁnition of length order, and supplied the running examples. Bill McKeeman broke out of the box with an automaton-based solution in Matlab, which inspired enumA. Discussion and solutions in various languages by other members of the working group have shed further light on the problem. I am also grateful for unstinting advice from Phil Wadler about Haskell and Al Aho about automata.
