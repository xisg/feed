# Zig: January 2018 in Review

One month (and a few days, sorry I'm late!) has passed since I did the
[December 2017 writeup](zig-december-2017-in-review.html), and so it's time for
another month-in-review for [my esteemed sponsors](https://github.com/users/andrewrk/sponsorship).

## LLVM 6 Readiness

[LLVM 6.0.0rc2](http://prereleases.llvm.org/6.0.0/) was just announced on the mailing list.
It's scheduled to be released on February 21, and Zig is ready.
I plan to have Zig release 0.2.0 one week after LLVM 6 comes out.
We already have all tests passing with debug builds of LLVM 6 in the
[llvm6 branch](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/tree/llvm6),
but that extra week is for a bug-stomping rampage.

After that, all the 0.3.0 milestone issues get postponed to 0.4.0, and all the
0.2.0 milestone issues get moved to 0.3.0.

0.2.0 will be an exciting release because, among many other things, it enables
source-level debugging with MSVC on Windows.

Zig is once again in the [release notes of LLVM](http://prereleases.llvm.org/6.0.0/rc2/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#zig-programming-language), so we should see a slight increase in community size when LLVM release notes hit the tech news headlines.

## Error Syntax Cleanup

One of the biggest complaints newcomers to Zig had was about its sigils regarding error handling.
Given this, I made an effort to choose friendlier syntax.

- `%return` is replaced with `try`
- `%defer` is replaced with `errdefer`
- `a %% b` is replaced with `a catch b`
- `%%x` is removed entirely to discourage its use.
   You can get an equivalent effect with `x catch unreachable`,
   which has been updated to understand that it was attempting to unwrap an error union.
   See [#545](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/545) and [#510](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/510)

After these changes, there is a strong pattern that only keywords can modify control flow.
For example we have `and` and `or` instead of `&&` and `||`. There is one last exception, which is `a ?? b`. Maybe it's okay, since [C# set a precedent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operator).

An even bigger change is coming soon which I'm calling
[Error Sets](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/632).

## Error Return Traces

I'm really excited about this one. I invented a new kind of debugging tool and integrated it into Debug and ReleaseSafe builds.

One of the concerns with removing the `%%` prefix operator was that it was
just so gosh darn convenient to get a stack trace right at the moment where you
asserted that a value did not have an error. I wanted to make it so that programmers
could use `try` everywhere and still get the debuggability benefit when
an error occurred.

Watch this:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.debug.global_allocator;

    const args = try std.os.argsAlloc(allocator);
    defer std.os.argsFree(allocator, args);

    const count = try parseFile(allocator, args[1]);

    if (count < 10) return error.NotEnoughItems;
}

fn parseFile(allocator: &std.mem.Allocator, file_path: []const u8) !usize {
    const contents = std.io.readFileAlloc(allocator, file_path) catch return error.UnableToReadFile;
    defer allocator.free(contents);

    return contents.len;
}
```

Here's a simple program with a bunch of different ways that errors could get returned
from `main`. In our test example, we're going to open a bogus file that
does not exist.

```
$ zig build-exe test2.zig
$ ./test2 bogus-does-not-exist.txt
error: UnableToReadFile
/home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/std/os/index.zig:301:33: 0x000000000021acd0 in ??? (test2)
                posix.ENOENT => return PosixOpenError.PathNotFound,
                                ^
/home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/std/os/file.zig:25:24: 0x00000000002096f6 in ??? (test2)
            const fd = try os.posixOpen(allocator, path, flags, 0);
                       ^
/home/andy/dev/zig/build/lib/zig/std/io.zig:267:16: 0x000000000021ebec in ??? (test2)
    var file = try File.openRead(allocator, path);
               ^
/home/andy/dev/zig/build/test2.zig:15:71: 0x000000000021ce72 in ??? (test2)
    const contents = std.io.readFileAlloc(allocator, file_path) catch return error.UnableToReadFile;
                                                                      ^
/home/andy/dev/zig/build/test2.zig:9:19: 0x000000000021c1f9 in ??? (test2)
    const count = try parseFile(allocator, args[1]);
                  ^

```

I'm going to include a picture of the above here, because it looks a lot better with
terminal colors:

![](https://superjoe.s3.amazonaws.com/blog-files/zig-january-2018-in-review/error-return-traces.png)

This is not a stack trace snapshot from when an error was "created". This is a **return trace** of all the points in the code where an error was returned from a function.

Note that, if it only told you the origin of the error that we ultimately received - `UnableToReadFile` \- we would only see the bottom 2 items in the trace.
Not only do we have this information, we have all the information about the origin of
the error, right up to the fact that we received `ENOENT` from `open`.

With this in place, programmers can comfortably use `try` everywhere, safe
in the knowledge that it will be straightforward to troubleshoot the origin of any error
bubbling up through the system.

I hope you're skeptically wondering, OK, what's the tradeoff in terms of binary size, performance, and memory?

First of all, this feature is disabled in ReleaseFast mode. So the answer is,
literally no cost, in this case. But what about Debug and ReleaseSafe builds?

To analyze performance cost, there are two cases:

- when no errors are returned
- when returning errors

For the case when no errors are returned, the cost is a single memory write operation, only in the first non-failable function in the call graph that calls a failable function, i.e. when a function returning `void` calls a function returning `error`.
This is to initialize this struct in the stack memory:

```zig
pub const StackTrace = struct {
    index: usize,
    instruction_addresses: [N]usize,
};
```

Here, N is the maximum function call depth as determined by call graph analysis. Recursion is ignored and counts for 2.

A pointer to `StackTrace` is passed as a secret parameter to every function that can return an error, but it's always the first parameter, so it can likely sit in a register and stay there.

That's it for the path when no errors occur. It's practically free in terms of performance.

When generating the code for a function that returns an error, just before the `return` statement (only for the `return` statements that return errors), Zig generates a call to this function:

```zig
noinline fn __zig_return_error(stack_trace: &StackTrace) void {
    stack_trace.instruction_addresses[stack_trace.index] = @returnAddress();
    stack_trace.index = (stack_trace.index + 1) % N;
}
```

The cost is 2 math operations plus some memory reads and writes. The memory accessed is constrained and should remain cached for the duration of the error return bubbling.

As for code size cost, 1 function call before a return statement is no big deal. Even so,
I have [a plan](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/690) to make the call to
`__zig_return_error` a tail call, which brings the code size cost down to actually zero. What is a return statement in code without error return tracing can become a jump instruction in code with error return tracing.

There are a few ways to activate this error return tracing feature:

- Return an error from main
- An error makes its way to `catch unreachable` and you have not overridden the default panic handler
- Use [@errorReturnTrace](http://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#errorReturnTrace) to access the current return trace. You can use `std.debug.dumpStackTrace` to print it. This function returns comptime-known `null` when building without error return tracing support.

## Documentation

Big news on the documentation front.

All the outdated docs are fixed, and we have automatic
[docgen tool](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/blob/46aa416c48c283849059292267ac25a6d0db76d6/doc/docgen.zig)
which:

- Automatically generates the table of contents
- Validates all internal links
- Validates all code examples
- Turns terminal coloring of stack traces and compile errors into HTML

The tool is, of course, written in Zig. [#465](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/465)

In addition to the above, the following improvements were made to the documentation:

- Added documentation for [@noInlineCall](http://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#noInlineCall)
- Added documentation for [extern enum](http://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#extern-enum)
- Improved the documentation styling
- Made the documentation a single file that has no external dependencies
- Add the documentation to appveyor build artifacts as `langref.html`. In other words we ship with the docs now.

**Marc Tiehuis** improved documentation styling for mobile devices. [#729](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/729)

- No overscrolling on small screens
- Font-size is reduced for more content per screen
- Tables + Code blocks scroll within a block to avoid page-widenening

There is still much more to document, before we have achieved [basic documentation for everything](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/367).

## Self-Hosted Compiler

The self-hosted compiler now fully successfully builds on Windows and MacOS.

The main test suite builds the self-hosted compiler.

The self-hosted build inherits the std lib file list and C header file list from the stage1 cmake build, as well as the `llvm-config` output. So if you get stage1 to build,
stage2 will reliably build as well.

## Windows 32-bit Support Status

Windows 32-bit mostly works, but there are some failing tests. The number of failing tests
grew and it didn't seem fair to claim that we supported it officially.

So I removed the claims that we support Windows 32-bit from the README, and removed
32-bit Windows from the testing matrix.

[We still want to support Windows 32-bit](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/537).

## Syntax: Mandatory Function Return Type

`->` is removed, and all functions require an explicit return type.

The purpose of this is:

- Only one way to do things
- Changing a function with void return type to return a possible
   error becomes a 1 character change, subtly encouraging
   people to use errors.

Here are some imperfect sed commands for performing this update:


remove arrow:


```
sed -i 's/\(\bfn\b.*\)-> /\1/g' $(find . -name "*.zig")
```

add void:


```
sed -i 's/\(\bfn\b.*\))\s*{/\1) void {/g' $(find . -name "*.zig")
```

Some cleanup may be necessary, but this should do the bulk of the work.


This has been a controversial change, and [may be reverted](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/760).

## Generating .h Files

- Now Zig emits compile errors for non-extern, non-packed struct, enum, unions in `extern` fn signatures.
- Zig generates .h file content for `extern` struct, enum, unions
- .h file generation is now tested in the main test suite.

Marc Tiehuis added array type handling:

```zig
const Foo = extern struct {
    A: [2]i32,
    B: [4]&u32,
};
export fn entry(foo: Foo, bar: [3]u8) void { }
```

This generates:

```c
struct Foo {
    int32_t A[2];
    uint32_t * B[4];
};

TEST_EXPORT void entry(struct Foo foo, uint8_t bar[]);
```

## Translating C to Zig

**Jimmi Holst Christensen** [improved translate-c](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/pull/695):

- output "undefined" on uninitialized variables
- correct translation of if statements on integers and floats

## Crypto Additions to Zig std lib

**Marc Tiehuis** added a bunch of crypto functions:

- added hardware sqrt for x86\_64.
   (See [#681](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/681))
- fixed bitrotted endian swapping std lib code
   (See [#682](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/682))

### Integer Rotation Functions

```zig
/// Rotates right. Only unsigned values can be rotated.
/// Negative shift values results in shift modulo the bit count.
pub fn rotr(comptime T: type, x: T, r: var) -> T {
test "math.rotr" {
    assert(rotr(u8, 0b00000001, usize(0))  == 0b00000001);
    assert(rotr(u8, 0b00000001, usize(9))  == 0b10000000);
    assert(rotr(u8, 0b00000001, usize(8))  == 0b00000001);
    assert(rotr(u8, 0b00000001, usize(4))  == 0b00010000);
    assert(rotr(u8, 0b00000001, isize(-1)) == 0b00000010);
}
/// Rotates left. Only unsigned values can be rotated.
/// Negative shift values results in shift modulo the bit count.
pub fn rotl(comptime T: type, x: T, r: var) -> T {
test "math.rotl" {
    assert(rotl(u8, 0b00000001, usize(0))  == 0b00000001);
    assert(rotl(u8, 0b00000001, usize(9))  == 0b00000010);
    assert(rotl(u8, 0b00000001, usize(8))  == 0b00000001);
    assert(rotl(u8, 0b00000001, usize(4))  == 0b00010000);
    assert(rotl(u8, 0b00000001, isize(-1)) == 0b10000000);
}
```

### MD5 and SHA1 Hash Functions

[Marc writes](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/pull/686):

Some performance comparisons to C.

We take the fastest time measurement taken across multiple runs.

The block hashing functions use the same md5/sha1 methods.

```
Cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz
Gcc: 7.2.1 20171224
Clang: 5.0.1
Zig: 0.1.1.304f6f1d

```

See [https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-md5-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-md5-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly):

```
gcc -O2
    661 Mb/s
clang -O2
    490 Mb/s
zig --release-fast and zig --release-safe
    570 Mb/s
zig
    50 Mb/s

```

See [https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha1-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-sha1-hash-implementation-in-x86-assembly)
:

```
gcc -O2
    588 Mb/s
clang -O2
    563 Mb/s
zig --release-fast and zig --release-safe
    610 Mb/s
zig
    21 Mb/s

```

In short, zig provides pretty useful tools for writing this sort of
code. We are in the lead against clang (which uses the same LLVM
backend) with us being slower only against md5 with GCC.

### SHA-2 Functions

[Marc writes](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/pull/687):

We take the fastest time measurement taken across multiple runs. Tested
across multiple compiler flags and the best chosen.

```

### Blake2 Hash Functions

[Marc writes](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/pull/689):

Blake performance numbers for reference:

```
Cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz

```

\-\- Blake2s

```

```
Zig --release-fast

```

### Sha3 Hashing Functions

[Marc writes:](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/pull/696)

These are on the slower side and could be improved. No performance optimizations
yet have been done.

```
Cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz

```

\-\- Sha3-256

```
Zig --release-fast
    93 Mb/s
Zig --release-safe
    99 Mb/s
Zig
    4 Mb/s

```

\-\- Sha3-512

```
Zig --release-fast
    49 Mb/s
Zig --release-safe
    54 Mb/s
Zig
    2 Mb/s

```

Interestingly, release-safe is producing slightly better code than
release-fast.

## Improvements

- The return type of `main` can now be `void`, `noreturn`, `u8`, or an error union. [#535](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/535)
- Implemented bigint div and rem. [#405](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/405)
- Removed coldcc keyword and added [@setCold](http://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#setCold). [#661](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/661)
- Renamed "debug safety" to "runtime safety". [#437](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/437)
- Updated windows build to use llvm 5.0.1.
   [Reported usability issue regarding diaguids.lib to llvm-dev.](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2018-January/120153.html)
- Implemented `std.os.selfExePath` and `std.os.selfExeDirPath` for windows.
- Added more test coverage.
- The same string literal codegens to the same constant.
   This makes it so that you can send the same string literal
   as a comptime slice and get the same type.


Zig now supports structs defined inside a function that reference local constants:

```zig
const assert = @import("std").debug.assert;

test "struct inside function" {
    const BlockKind = u32;

    const Block = struct {
        kind: BlockKind,
    };

    var block = Block { .kind = 1234 };

    block.kind += 1;

    assert(block.kind == 1235);
}
```

This fixed [#672](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/672) and [#552](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/552). However there is still issue [#675](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig/issues/675) which is that structs inside
functions get named after the function they are in:

```zig
test "struct inside function" {
    const Block = struct { kind: u32 };
    @compileLog(@typeName(Block));
}
```

When executed gives

```
| "struct inside function()"

```

Moving on, Zig now allows enum tag values to not be in parentheses:

```zig
const EnumWithTagValues = enum(u4) {
    A = 1 << 0,
    B = 1 << 1,
    C = 1 << 2,
    D = 1 << 3,
};
```

Previously this required `A = (1 << 0)`.
