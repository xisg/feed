# JavaScript Callbacks are Pretty Okay

I've seen a fair amount of
[callback bashing](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2013/Aug-15.html)
on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) recently.

Among the many proposed solutions, one of them strikes me as
particularly clean: "asynchronous wait" or "wait and defer".
[iced-coffee-script](http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/) had
this a while ago.
[Kal](http://rzimmerman.github.io/kal/) just debuted with an
identical solution, only differing in syntax.
Supposedly [LiveScript supports this with "backcalls"](http://livescript.net/#backcalls).

I must say, "asynchronous wait" or "monads" - whatever you want to call it -
seems like an improvement over callbacks.
But I'm here to say that actually... callbacks are pretty okay.
Further, given how clean callbacks can be, the downsides of using
a compile-to-js language often outweigh the benefits.

I have 2 rules of thumb for code organization which makes clean
callback based async code brainless:

1. Avoid nontrivial anonymous functions.
2. Put all function declarations _after_ the code that actually does things.

### Example

compile-to-js languages often show examples of deeply nested callback code
to show how it can be refactored in the language. Let's take one from
[Kal](http://rzimmerman.github.io/kal/):

```javascript
function getUserFriends(userName, next) {
    db.users.findOne({name:userName}, function (err, user) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        db.friends.find({userId:user.id}, function (err, friends) {
            if (err != null) return next(err);
            return next(null, friends);
        });
    });
}

```

Yikes that does look a bit nested. But let's apply the first rule and un-nest
both of those anonymous functions.

```javascript
function getUserFriends(userName, next) {
    db.users.findOne({name:userName}, foundOne);

    function foundOne(err, user) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        db.friends.find({userId:user.id}, foundFriends);
    }

    function foundFriends(err, friends) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        return next(null, friends);
    }
}

```

It's actually longer now, but it's much easier to parse.
When you want to learn what any given function does, you only have to understand
1-2 lines.
For example, `getUserFriends` really only has 1 line which is the
`findOne` part.
The rest is a list of function declarations.
Next you probably want to learn what the `foundOne` function does,
so you jump to it and only have to read 2 lines to know what it does.
Finally you probably want to learn what the `foundFriends` function
does, so you jump to it, and again, only have to read 2 lines.

### Example

Here's another one taken from Kal (sorry to pick on you
[rzimmerman](https://github.com/rzimmerman); you have good examples):

```javascript
var async = require('async');

var getUserFriends = function (userName, next) {
    db.users.findOne({name:userName}, function (err, user) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        getFriendsById(user.id, function (err, friends) {
            if (err != null) return next(err);
            if (user.type == 'power user') {
                async.map(friends, getFriendsById, function (err, friendsOfFriends) {
                    for (var i = 0; i < friendsOfFriends.length; i++) {
                        for (var j = 0; j < friendsOfFriends[i].length; j++) {
                            if (friends.indexOf(friendsOfFriends[i][j]) != -1) {
                                friends.push(friendsOfFriends[i][j]);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    return next(null, friends);
                });
            } else {
                return next(null, friends);
            }
        });
    });
}
var getFriendsById = function (userId, next) {
    db.friends.find({userId:userId}, function (err, friends) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        return next(null, friends);
    });
}

```

Yep that is an eyesore. Let's see what the 2 rules do.

```javascript
var async = require('async');

function getUserFriends(userName, next) {
    db.users.findOne({name:userName}, foundUser);

    function foundUser(err, user) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        getFriendsById(user.id, gotFriends);

        function gotFriends(err, friends) {
            if (err != null) return next(err);
            if (user.type == 'power user') {
                async.map(friends, getFriendsById, wtfFriendAction);
            } else {
                return next(null, friends);
            }

            function wtfFriendAction(err, friendsOfFriends) {
                for (var i = 0; i < friendsOfFriends.length; i++) {
                    for (var j = 0; j < friendsOfFriends[i].length; j++) {
                        if (friends.indexOf(friendsOfFriends[i][j]) != -1) {
                            friends.push(friendsOfFriends[i][j]);
                        }
                    }
                }
                return next(null, friends);
            }
        }
    }
}

function getFriendsById(userId, next) {
    db.friends.find({userId:userId}, function (err, friends) {
        if (err != null) return next(err);
        return next(null, friends);
    });
}

```

Okay actually while refactoring that code I realized it made no sense, hence
my naming of `wtfFriendAction`. But let's run with it.

In this refactored code, we've only reduced the maximum nesting by 1 - from 8 to 7.
But consider how much easier it is to follow.
When you look at any given function, there are a few lines of
synchronous code, followed by function declarations.
Exception - I left `getFriendsById` alone since it is so short.

### Quick note on the downsides of compile-to-js languages

First to note - Coffee-Script actually _prohibits_ this kind of code
organization, because all functions are necessarily assignments.
Other compile-to-js languages solve this problem by providing function
declarations.
But all compile-to-js languages have some fundamental problems.

For one, you increase the barrier to contributions to your code.
People are a bazillion times more likely to create a pull request if they
already know the language your module or app is written in.
When you pick an obscure language to write your code in, you alienate
a large number of potential contributors.

It gets worse. Most people, when evaluating a module or app, will
quickly scan the source code to see if the implementation looks reasonable.
The depth of analyzation may not be too great; people are looking for
obvious problems.
When they see that it's written in another language, it makes the codebase
seem foreign; possibly even untrusted. At the very least it hampers their
ability to judge quality.

Finally, it means adding a build step to your code. Often this is not a big deal;
you may already have a build step. But it is an additional moving part in your
project that must be understood by you and any potential contributors, or even
potential users.

I probably sound like one of those grumps who scoffed at any programming language
higher-level than assembly.
But I actually really got into Coffee-Script for a while, then switched over
to [coco](https://github.com/satyr/coco/) due to it solving some
problems better. I have a [nontrivial music player app](https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin) written in coco. It was first in JavaScript, then Coffee-Script, then coco.
But I've converted back to pure JavaScript in the active working branch.
The first version of [naught](https://github.com/andrewrk/naught)
was written in coco but that's now JavaScript as well.
I learned the hard way about some of these tradeoffs.

### Conclusion

I've outlined 2 simple rules for callback organization that I think make writing
async code in pure JavaScript more than adequate.
To review:

1. Avoid nontrivial anonymous functions.
2. Function declarations _after_ the code that actually does things.

Both principles aim for the same goal:
A reader of your code should be able to look at the code that actually does
things synchronously all together.
This means placing all the stuff that happens later at the end.

I'm not one to hinder progress in the world of programming languages,
but I thought I'd share my perspective on why I still write pure JavaScript
for Node.js and browser apps.
