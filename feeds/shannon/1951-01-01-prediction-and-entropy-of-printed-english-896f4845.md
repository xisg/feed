# Prediction and Entropy of Printed English

Prediction and Entropy of Printed English
                                By C. E. SHANNON
                          (Manuscript Received Sept. 75,
       A new method of estimating the entropy and redundancy of a language is
    described. This method exploits the knowledge of the language statistics pos-
    sessed by those who speak the language, and depends on experimental results
    in prediction of the next letter when the preceding text is known. Results of
    experiments in prediction are given, and some properties of an ideal predictor are
    developed.

                                  1. INTRODUCTION
   N A previous paper1 the entropy and redundancy of a language have
I   been defined. The entropy is a statistical parameter which measures,
in a certain sense, how much information is produced on the average for
each letter of a text in the language. If the language is translated into binary
digits (0 or 1) in the most efficient way, the entropy // is the average number
of binary digits required per letter of the original language. The redundancy,
on the other hand, measures the amount of constraint imposed on a text in
the language due to its statistical structure, e.g., in English the high fre-
quency of the letter £, the strong tendency of H to follow T or of V to follow
Q. It was estimated that when statistical effects extending over not more
than eight letters are considered the entropy is roughly 2.3 bits per letter,
the redundancy about 50 per cent.
   Since then a new method has been found for estimating these quantities,
which is more sensitive and takes account of long range statistics, influences
extending over phrases, sentences, etc. This method is based on a study of
the predictability of English; how well can the next letter of a text be pre-
dicted when the preceding N letters are known. The results of some experi-
ments in prediction will be given, and a theoretical analysis of some of the
properties of ideal prediction. By combining the experimental and theoreti-
cal results it is possible to estimate upper and lower bounds for the entropy
and redundancy. From this analysis it appears that, in ordinary literary
English, the long range statistical effects (up to 100 letters) reduce the
entropy to something of the order of one bit per letter, with a corresponding
redundancy of roughly 75%. The redundancy may be still higher when
structure extending over paragraphs, chapters, etc. is included. However, as
the lengths involved are increased, the parameters in question become more

the Y-grani entropy; it measures the amount of information or entropy due
to statistics extending over A" adjacent letters of text. F.v is given by1

            j is an arbitrary letter following hi

            pbi(j) is the conditional probability of letter j after the block b,,
                       and is given by p(b{ , j)/p(bf).
  The equation (1) can be interpreted as measuring the average uncertainty
(conditional entropy) of the next letter /' when the preceding _V-1 letters are
known. As .V is increased, /'V includes longer and longer range statistics
and the entropy, 77, is given by the limiting value of FN as N — -> ^ :

  The T-gram entropies F.\ for small values of N can be calculated from
standard tables of letter, digram and trigram frequencies.2 If spaces and
punctuation are ignored we have a twenty-six letter alphabet and Ff, may

     The trigram entropy is given by
        F-i = - Z p(i,j,k) log, p,-j(k)

                   X p(i, j, k) log, p(i, j, k)          (*, j) log, p(i, j)    (5)

           = 11.0 - 7,7 = 3.3
 In this calculation the trigram table2 used did not take into account tri-
 grams bridging two words, such as WOW and OWO in TWO WORDS. To
 compensate partially for this omission, corrected trigram probabilities p(it
j, k) were obtained from the probabilities p'(i,j, k) of the table by the follow-
 ing rough formula:

            , J,   = ~ p'(i,j, k) + ~ r(f)p(j, k)

where r(i) is the probability of letter i as the terminal letter of a word and
s(k) is the probability of k as an initial letter. Thus the trigrams within
words (an average of 2.5 per word) are counted according to the table; the
bridging trigrams (one of each type per word) are counted approximately
by assuming independence of the terminal letter of one word and the initial
digram in the next or vice versa. Because of the approximations involved
here, and also because of the fact that the sampling error in identifying
probability with sample frequency is more serious, the value of F;i is less
reliable than the previous numbers.
   Since tables of .Y-gram frequencies were not available for ,Y > 3, F^ , Fj ,
etc. could not be calculated in the same way. However, word frequencies
have been tabulated3 and can be used to obtain a further approximation.
Figure 1 is a plot on log-log paper of the probabilities of words against
frequency rank. The most frequent English word "the" has a probability
.071 and this is plotted against 1. The next most frequent word "of" has a
probability of .034 and is plotted against 2, etc. Using logarithmic scales
both for probability and rank, the curve is approximately a straight line
with slope — 1 ; thus, if pn is the probability of the rath most frequent word,
we have, roughly

Zipf4 has pointed out that this type of formula, pn = k/n, gives a rather good
approximation to the word probabilities in many different languages. The

actually the ordinate of the /*'>• curve at N = 4.5 will be above this value.

  The data of Table I can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds to th
AT-gram entropies FN • In order to do this, it is necessary first to develop
some general results concerning the best possible prediction of a languagt
when the preceding N letters are known. There will be for the language a set
of conditional probabilities/)^ , » , , • • • , *y_i (j). This is the probability whet
the (N-\) gram ii , iz , • • • , in-i occurs that the next letter will be j. Th
best guess for the next letter, when this (Ar-l) gram is known to have oc-
curred, will be that letter having the highest conditional probability. The
second guess should be that with the second highest probability, etc. A
machine or person guessing in the best way would guess letters in the ordei
of decreasing conditional probability. Thus the process of reducing a ter
with such an ideal predictor consists of a mapping of the letters into tb:
numbers from 1 to 27 in such a way that the most probable next lette:
[conditional on the known preceding (A7-l) gram] is mapped into 1, etc
The frequency of 1's in the reduced text will then be given by

where the sum is taken over all (N-\) grams ii , i2 , • • • , in-\ the j being tin
one which maximizes p for that particular (N-\) gram. Similarly, the fn
quency of 2's, q% , is given by the same formula with j chosen to be tha
letter having the second highest value of p, etc.
   On the basis of A7-grams, a different set of probabilities for the symbol

m
   H' tion is on the basis of a greater knowledge of the past, one would ex-
   t the probabilities of low numbers to be greater, and in fact one can
prove the following inequalities:

Th's means that the probability of being right in the first S guesses when
the preceding N letters are known is greater than or equal to that when
   lv C/V-1) are known, for all S. To prove this, imagine the probabilities
•bd ii, " ' , i" > •?') arrang£d in a table with j running horizontally and all
the TV-grams vertically. The table will therefore have 27 columns and 27N
rows The term on the left of (11) is the sum of the S largest entries in each
row summed over all the rows. The right-hand member of (11) is also a sum
of entries from this table in which S entries are taken from each row but not
necessarily the S largest. This follows from the fact that the right-hand
member would be calculated from a similar table with (TV-1) grams rather
than TV-grams listed vertically. Each row in the TV-1 gram table is the sum
of 27 rows of the TV-gram table, since:
                                          27

              p ( k j is, • • • , iy,j) = IL P(ii ,i"z, '' • , itr,j).       (12)
                                           .1=1
  The sum of the S largest entries in a row of the TV-1 gram table will equal
the sum of the 27S selected entries from the corresponding 27 rows of the
TV-gram table only if the latter fall into S columns. For the equality in (11)
to hold for a particular S, this must be true of every row of the TV-1 gram
table. In this case, the first letter of the TV-gram does not affect the set of the
S most probable choices for the next letter, although the ordering within
the set may be affected. However, if the equality in (11) holds for all S, it
follows that the ordering as well will be unaffected by the first letter of the
JV-gram. The reduced text obtained from an ideal .V-l gram predictor is then
identical with that obtained from an ideal N-gram predictor.
  Since the partial sums

                      Qs = E ql                5 = 1,2,--.                    (13)

are monotonic increasing functions of N, < 1 for all N, they must all ap-
proach limits as N —^ «>. Their first differences must therefore approach
limits as TV —> =o , i.e., the </j approach limits, q™ . These may be interpreted
as the relative frequency of correct first, second, • • • , guesses with knowl-
edge of the entire (infinite) past history of the text.

  The ideal A7-gram predictor can be considered, as has been pointed out, t0
be a transducer which operates on the language translating it into a sequence
of numbers running from 1 to 27. As such it has the following two properties'
   1. The output symbol is a function of the present input (the predicted
      next letter when we think of it as a predicting device) and the prece<J.
      ing (A7-!) letters.
   2. It is instantaneously reversible. The original input can be recovered by
      a suitable operation on the reduced text without loss of time. In fact
      the inverse operation also operates on only the (N-\) preceding sym,
      bols of the reduced text together with the present output.
  The above proof that the frequencies of output symbols with an N.\
gram predictor satisfy the inequalities:

can be applied to any transducer having the two properties listed above,
In fact we can imagine again an array with the various (A7-l) grams listed
vertically and the present input letter horizontally. Since the present output
is a function of only these quantities there will be a definite output symbol
which may be entered at the corresponding intersection of row and column,
Furthermore, the instantaneous reversibility requires that no two entries
in the same row be the same. Otherwise, there would be ambiguity between
the two or more possible present input letters when reversing the transla.
tion. The total probability of the 5 most probable symbols in the output,
          s
say ^ri, will be the sum of the probabilities for 5 entries in each row, summed
     i
over the rows, and consequently is certainly not greater than the sum of the
5 largest entries in each row. Thus we will have

                           Z <??>!>,•            5 = 1, 2 , . - . , 27              (15)

In other words ideal prediction as denned above enjoys a preferred position
among all translating operations that may be applied to a language am
which satisfy the two properties above. Roughly speaking, ideal prediction
collapses the probabilities of various symbols to a small group more than
any other translating operation involving the same number of letters whict
is instantaneously reversible.
  Sets of numbers satisfying the inequalities (15) have been studied by
Muirhead in connection with the theory of algebraic inequalities.6 If (15

   \vn that the majorizing property is equivalent to either of the following
properties:
  1 The r> can be obtained from the qt by a finite series of "flows." By a
     flow is understood a transfer of probability from a larger q to a smaller
     one, as heat flows from hotter to cooler bodies but not in the reverse
     direction.

     operation. There exists a set of non-negative real numbers, a a , with

                                                                                              (16)

               5. ENTROPY BOUNDS FROM PREDICTION FREQUENCIES
   If we know the frequencies of symbols in the reduced text with the ideal
jV-gram predictor, <?»• , it is possible to set both upper and lower bounds to
the A^gram entropy, FN , of the original language. These bounds are as
follows:

                       i(q" - ?i+i) log i < FN < — ]C q" log q".                              (17)
                  =1
  The upper bound follows immediately from the fact that the maximum
possible entropy in a language with letter frequencies q" is — ^ ql log ql.
Thus the entropy per symbol of the reduced text is not greater than this.
The JV-gram entropy of the reduced text is equal to that for the original
language, as may be seen by an inspection of the definition (1) of FX . The
sums involved will contain precisely, the same terms although, perhaps, in a
different order. This upper bound is clearly valid, whether or not the pre-
diction is ideal.
  The lower bound is more difficult to establish. It is necessary to show that
with any selection of Ar-gram probabilities p(ii, i%, ... , i N ) , we will have
     27

     Ys i(q*i — 9?+i) log i <           X          p(i, ' • • if/) log pi, • • • iff-i(iff)    (18)
     •—1                         i i, • • •, ijv

The left-hand member of the inequality can be interpreted as follows:
Imagine the q* arranged as a sequence of lines of decreasing height (Fig. 3).
The actual q* can be considered as the sum of a set of rectangular distribu-
tions as shown. The left member of (18) is the entropy of this set of distribu-
tions. Thus, the i'h rectangular distribution has a total probability of

   Working from the data of Table I, the upper and lower bounds were calcu-
lated from relations (17). The data were first smoothed somewhat to over-
come the worst sampling fluctuations. The low numbers in this table are
the least reliable and these were averaged together in groups. Thus, in
column 4, the 47, 18 and 14 were not changed but the remaining group
totaling 21 was divided uniformly over the rows from 4 to 20. The upper and
lower bounds given by (17) were then calculated for each column giving the
following results:
     Column       1      2     3    4    5     6    7    8    9    10    11   12    13   14    15   100

It is evident that there is still considerable sampling error in these figures
due to identifying the observed sample frequencies with the prediction
probabilities. It must also be remembered that the lower bound was proved
only for the ideal predictor, while the frequencies used here are from human
prediction. Some rough calculations, however, indicate that the discrepancy
between the actual VK and the lower bound with ideal prediction (due to
the failure to have rectangular distributions of conditional probability)
more than compensates for the failure of human subjects to predict in the
ideal manner. Thus we feel reasonably confident of both bounds apart from
sampling errors. The values given above are plotted against N in Fig. 4.
