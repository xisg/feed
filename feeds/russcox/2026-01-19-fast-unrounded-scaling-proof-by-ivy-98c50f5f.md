# Fast Unrounded Scaling: Proof by Ivy

My post “ [Floating-Point Printing and Parsing Can Be Simple And Fast](fp)”
depends on fast unrounded scaling, defined as:

⟨x⟩=⌊2x⌋\|\|(2x≠⌊2x⌋)uscale(x,e,p)=⟨x·2e·10p⟩

The unrounded form of x∈ℝ, ⟨x⟩, is the integer value of ⌊x⌋ concatenated
with two more bits:
first, the “½ bit” from the binary representation of x (the bit representing 2−1; 1 if x−⌊x⌋≥½; or equivalently, ⌊2x⌋mod2); and second,
a “sticky bit” that is 1 if _any_ bits beyond the ½ bit were 1.

These are all equivalent definitions, using the convention that a boolean condition is 1 for true, 0 for false:

⟨x⟩=⌊x⌋\|\|(x−⌊x⌋≥½)\|\|(x−⌊x⌋∉0,½)(‘\|\|’isbitconcatenation)=⌊x⌋\|\|(x−⌊x⌋≥½)\|\|(2x≠⌊2x⌋)=⌊2x⌋\|\|(2x≠⌊2x⌋)=⌊4x⌋\|(2x≠⌊2x⌋)(‘\|’isbitwiseOR)=⌊4x⌋\|(4x≠⌊4x⌋)

The uscale operation computes the unrounded form of x·2e·10p,
so it needs to compute the integer ⌊2·x·2e·10p⌋
and then also whether the floor truncated any bits.
One approach would be to compute 2·x·2e·10p as an exact rational,
but we want to avoid arbitrary-precision math.
A faster approach is to use a floating-point approximation for 10p:
10p≈𝑝𝑚·2𝑝𝑒, where 𝑝𝑚 is 128 bits.
Assuming x<264, this requires a single 64×128→192-bit multiplication,
implemented by two full-width 64×64→128-bit multplications on a 64-bit computer.

The algorithm, which we will call Scale, is given integers x, e, and p subject to certain constraints
and operates as follows:

Scale(x,e,p):

1. Let 𝑝𝑒=−127−⌈log210−p⌉.

2. Let 𝑝𝑚=⌈10p/2𝑝𝑒⌉, looked up in a table indexed by p.

3. Let b=bits(x), the number of bits in the binary representation of x.

4. Let m=e+𝑝𝑒+b−1.

5. Let 𝑡𝑜𝑝=⌊x·𝑝𝑚/2m/2b⌋,𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=⌊x·𝑝𝑚/2b⌋mod2m,𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚=x·𝑝𝑚mod2b.


   Put another way, split x·𝑝𝑚 into 𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒\|\|bottom where 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 is b bits, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 is m bits, and 𝑡𝑜𝑝 is the remaining bits.

6. Return ⟨(𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒)/2m+1⟩, computed as 𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0) or as 𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2).

The initial `uscale` implementation in the main post uses (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0) in its result,
but an optimized version uses (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2).

This post proves both versions of Scale correct for the x, e, and p
needed by the three floating-point conversion algorithms in the main post.
Those algorithms are:

- `FixedWidth` converts floating-point to decimal.
  It needs to call Scale with a 53-bit x, e∈\[−1137,960\], and p∈\[−307,341\],
  chosen to produce a result r∈\[0,2·1018), which is at most 61 bits
  (62-bit output; b=53,m≥128−62=66).

- `Short` also converts floating-point to decimal.
  It needs to call Scale with a 55-bit x, e∈\[−1137,960\], and p∈\[−292,324\],
  chosen to produce a result r∈\[0,2·1018), still at most 61 bits.
  (62-bit output; b=55,m≥128−62=66).

- `Parse` converts decimal to floating-point.
  It needs to call Scale with a 64-bit x and p∈\[−343,289\],
  chosen to produce a result r∈\[0,254), which is at most 54 bits
  (55-bit output; b=64,m≥128−55=73).


The “output” bit counts include the ½ bit but not the sticky bit.
Note that for a given x and p, the maximum result size
determines a relatively narrow range of possible e.

To start the proof, consider a hypothetical algorithm Scaleℝ
that is the same as Scale except using exact real numbers.
(Technically, only rationals are required, so this _could_ be implemented, but it is only a thought experiment.)

Scaleℝ(x,e,p):

1. Let 𝑝𝑒=−127−⌈log210−p⌉.

2. Let 𝑝𝑚ℝ=10p/2𝑝𝑒.


   (Note: 𝑝𝑚ℝ is an exact value, not a ceiling.)

3. Let b=bits(x).

4. Let m=−e−pe−b−1.

5. Let 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ=⌊x·𝑝𝑚ℝ/2m/2b⌋,𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ=⌊x·𝑝𝑚/2b⌋mod2m,𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=x·𝑝𝑚mod2b.


   (Note: 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ are integers, but 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ is an exact value that may not be an integer.)

6. Return ⟨(𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ)/2b+m+1⟩, computed as 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0).

Using exact reals makes it straighforward to prove Scaleℝ correct.

**Lemma 1**. Scaleℝ computes uscale(x,e,p).

_Proof_. Expand the math in the final result:

𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ=⌊x·𝑝𝑚ℝ/2m/2b⌋\[definitionof𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\]=⌊x·10p/2𝑝𝑒/2m/2b⌋\[definitionof𝑝𝑚ℝ\]=⌊x·10p/2𝑝𝑒/2−e−𝑝𝑒−b−1/2b⌋\[definitionofm\]=⌊x·10p·2−𝑝𝑒+e+𝑝𝑒+b+1−b⌋\[rearranging\]=⌊x·10p·2e+1⌋\[simplifying\]=⌊2·x·2e·10p⌋\[rearranging\]𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ≠0or𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0=⌊x·𝑝𝑚/2b⌋mod2m≠0orxmod2b≠0\[definitionof𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ,𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ\]=x·𝑝𝑚ℝmod2m+b≠0\[simplifying\]=⌊x·𝑝𝑚ℝ/2m+b⌋≠x·𝑝𝑚ℝ/2m+b\[definitionoffloorandmod\]=⌊2·x·2e·10p⌋≠2·x·2e·10p\[reusingexpansionofx·𝑝𝑚ℝ/2m/2babove\]Scaleℝ=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ≠0or𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0)\[definitionofScaleℝ\]=⌊2·x·2e·10p⌋\|\|⌊2·x·2e·10p⌋≠2·x·2e·10p\[applyingprevioustwoexpansions\]=⟨x·2e·10p⟩\[definitionof⟨...⟩\]=uscale(x,e,p)\[definitionofscale\]

So Scaleℝ(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p). ∎

Next we can establish basic conditions that make Scale correct.

**Lemma 2**. If 𝑡𝑜𝑝=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ and (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0)≡(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0),
then Scale computes uscale(x,e,p).

_Proof_. Scaleℝ(x,e,p)=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0),
while Scale(x,e,p)=𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0).
If 𝑡𝑜𝑝=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ and (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0)≡(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0),
then these expressions are identical.
Since Scaleℝ(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) (by [Lemma 1](#lemma1)), so does Scale(x,e,p). ∎

Now we need to show that 𝑡𝑜𝑝=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ and (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0)≡(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0)
in all cases.
We will also show that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1 to justify using
𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2 in place of 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0 when that’s convenient.

Note that 𝑝𝑚=⌈𝑝𝑚ℝ⌉=𝑝𝑚ℝ+ε0 for ε0∈\[0,1), and so:

x·𝑝𝑚=x·(𝑝𝑚ℝ+ε0)=x·𝑝𝑚ℝ+ε1,ε1=x·ε0∈\[0,2b)𝑡𝑜𝑝\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ+ε1

The proof analyzes the effect of the addition of ε1
to the ideal result 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ.
Since 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ is b bits and ε1 is at most b bits,
adding ε1>0 always causes 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚≠𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ.
(Talking about the low b bits of a real number is unusual;
we mean the low b integer bits followed by all the fractional bits: x·𝑝𝑚ℝmod2b.)

The question is whether that addition overflows and propagates
a carry into 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 or even 𝑡𝑜𝑝.
There are two main cases: exact results (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0)
and inexact results (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0).

## [Exact Results](\#exact_results)

Exact results have no error, making them match Scaleℝ exactly.

**Lemma 3**. For exact results, Scale computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

_Proof_. For an exact result, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0,
meaning 2·x·2e·10p is an integer
and the sticky bit is 0.
Since 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ is b zero bits, adding ε1 affects
𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚 but does not carry into 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 or 𝑡𝑜𝑝.
Therefore 𝑡𝑜𝑝=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ=0.
The latter, combined with 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0,
makes (𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0)≡(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0) trivially true
(both sides are false).
By [Lemma 2](#lemma2), Scale is correct.
And since 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.
∎

[**Inexact Results**](#inexact_results)

Inexact results are more work.
We will reduce the correctness to a few conditions on 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒.

**Lemma 4.** For inexact results, if 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0, then Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p).

_Proof_. For an inexact result, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0.
The only possible change from 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ to 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 is a carry
from the error addition 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ+ε1 overflowing 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚.
That carry is at most 1, so 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ+ε2)mod2m
for ε2∈\[0,1\].
An overflow into 𝑡𝑜𝑝 leaves 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0.
If 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0 then there can be no overflow, so 𝑡𝑜𝑝=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ.
By [Lemma 2](#lemma2), Scale computes uscale(x,e,p). ∎

For some cases, it will be more convenient to prove the range of 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ
instead of the range of 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒. For that we can use a variant of [Lemma 4](#lemma4).

**Lemma 5.** For inexact results, if 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[1,2m−2\] then Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p).

_Proof_. If 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[1,2m−2\], then 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ+ε2∈\[1,2m−1\],
so the mod in 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=(𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ+ε2)mod2m
does nothing (there is no overflow and wraparound),
so 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ+ε2≥1.
By [Lemma 4](#lemma4), Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p). ∎

A related lemma helps with middle≠1.

**Lemma 6**. For inexact results, if 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[2,2m−2\], then 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2.

_Proof_. Again there is no overflow,
so 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ≥2.
∎

Now we need to prove either that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[2,2m−2\] or that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠0 for all inexact results.
We will consider four cases:

- \[Small Positive Powers\] p∈\[0,27\] and b≤64.

- \[Small Negative Powers\] p∈\[−27,−1\] and b≤64.

- \[Large Powers, Printing\] p∈\[−400,−28\]∪\[28,400\], b≤55, m≥66.

- \[Large Powers, Parsing\] p∈\[−400,−28\]∪\[28,400\], b≤64, m≥73.

 [**Small Positive Powers**](#small_positive_powers)

**Lemma 7**. For inexact results and p∈\[0,27\] and b≤64, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

_Proof_. 5p<263, so the non-zero bits of 𝑝𝑚ℝ fits in the high 63 bits.
That implies that the b+128-bit product x·𝑝𝑚ℝ=𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ\|\|𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ ends in 65 zero bits.
Since b≤64, that means 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0 and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ’s low bit is zero.

Because the result is inexact, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ≠0, which implies 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ≠0
(since 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0).
Since 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ’s low bit is zero, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[2,2m−2\].
By [Lemma 5](#lemma5), Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p).
By [Lemma 6](#lemma6), 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1. ∎

[**Small Negative Powers**](#small_negative_powers)

**Lemma 8**. For inexact results and p∈\[−27,−1\] and b≤64, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

_Proof_. Scaling by 2e cannot introduce inexactness, since it just adds or subtracts from
the exponent. The only inexactness must come from 10p, specifically the 5p part.
Since p<0 and 1/5 is not exactly representable in a binary fraction,
the result is inexact if and only if xmod5−p≠0 (remember that −p is positive!).

Since 𝑝𝑚ℝ∈\[2127,2128) and 5−p<2−2, 𝑝𝑚ℝ=5−p·2k for some k≥130.
Since m+b≤128, 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ=⌊x·2k−(m+b)/5−p⌋
and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=2m+b·(x·2k−(m+b)mod5−p)/5−p.
That is, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ encodes some non-zero binary fraction with
denominator 5−p.
Note also that x·𝑝𝑚 is b+128 bits and the output is at most 64 bits we have m≥64,
so 2m·2−63≥2.

That implies

𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ∈2m+b·(5−27,1−5−27)⊂2m+b·(2−63,1−2−63)𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈2m·(2−63,1−2−63)⊂(2,2m−2)

By [Lemma 5](#lemma5) and [Lemma 6](#lemma6), Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1. ∎

[**Large Powers**](#large_powers)

That leaves p∈\[−400,−28\]∪\[28,400\].
There are not many 𝑝𝑚 to check—under a thousand—but there are far too many x to
exhaustively test that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2 for all of them.
Instead, we will have to be a bit more clever.

It would be simplest if we could prove that all possible 𝑝𝑚 and all x∈\[1,264)
result in a non-zero middle,
but that turns out not to be the case.

For example, using p=−29, x=0x8e151cee6e31e067 is a problem,
which we can verify using [the Ivy calculator](https://github.com/robpike/ivy):

```
# hex x is the hex formatting of x (as text)
op hex x = '#x' text x

# spaced adds spaces to s between sections of 16 characters
op spaced s = (count s) <= 18: s; (spaced -16 drop s), ' ', -16 take s

# pe returns the binary exponent for 10**p.
op pe p = -(127+ceil 2 log 10**-p)

# pm returns the 128-bit mantissa for 10**p.
op pm p = ceil (10**p) / 2**pe p

spaced hex (pm -29) * 0x8e151cee6e31e067
-- out --
0x7091bfc45568750f 0000000000000000 d81262b60aa6e8b7

```

We might perhaps think the problem is that 10−29 is too close to the small negative powers,
but positive powers break too:

```
spaced hex (pm 31) * 0x93997b98618e62a1
-- out --
0x918b5cd9fd69fdc5 0000000000000000 6d00000000000000

```

We might yet hope that the zeros were not caused by an error carry;
then as long as we force the inexact bit to 1, we could still use the high bits.
And indeed, for both of the previous examples, the zeros are not caused
by an error carry: 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ is all zeros.
But that is not always the case. Here is a middle that is zero due to an error carry
that overflowed into the top bits:

```
spaced hex (pm 62) * 0xd5bc71e52b31e483
spaced hex ((10**62) * 0xd5bc71e52b31e483) >> (pe 62)
-- out --
0xcfd352e73dc6ddc3 0000000000000000 774bd77b38816199
0xcfd352e73dc6ddc2 ffffffffffffffff e6fdb9b19804952a

```

Instead of proving the completely general case,
we will have to pick our battles
and focus on the specific cases we need for floating-point conversions.

We don’t need to try every possible input width below the maximum b.
Looking at Scale, it is clear that
the inputs x and x·2k have the same 𝑡𝑜𝑝 and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒,
and also that 𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚(x·2k)=𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚(x)·2k.
Since the middles are the same, the condition 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2 has
the same truth value for both inputs.
So we can limit our analysis to maximum-width b-bit inputs in \[2b−1,2b).
Similarly, we can prove that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2 for m≥k by proving it for m=k:
moving more bits from the low end of 𝑡𝑜𝑝 to the high end of 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒
cannot make 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 a smaller number.

Proving that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2 for the cases we listed above means proving:

- \[Printing\] (b≤55, m≥66.)


  For all large p and all x∈\[254,255): x·𝑝𝑚mod255+66=121≥255+1=56.

- \[Parsing\] (b≤64, m≥73.)


  For all large p and all x∈\[263,264): x·𝑝𝑚mod264+73=137≥264+1=65.

To prove these two conditions, we are going to write an Ivy program to analyze each 𝑝𝑚 separately,
proving that all relevant x satisfy the condition.

Ivy has arbitrary-precision rationals and lightweight syntax,
making it a convenient tool for sketching and testing mathematical algorithms,
in the spirit of Iverson’s Turing Award lecture about APL,
“ [Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283935).”
Like APL, Ivy uses strict right-to-left operator precedence:
`1+2*3+4` means `(1+(2*(3+4)))`,
and `floor 10 log f` means `floor (10 log f)`.
Operators can be prefix unary like `floor` or infix binary like `log`.
Each of the Ivy displays in this post is executable:
you can edit the code and re-run them by clicking the Play button (“▶️”).
A full introduction to Ivy is beyond the scope of this post;
see [the Ivy demo](https://swtch.com/ivy/demo.html) for more examples.

We’ve already started the proof program above by defining `pm` and `pe`.
Let’s continue by defining a few more helpers.

First let’s define `is`, an assertion for basic testing of other functions:

```
# is asserts that x === y.
op x is y =
    x === y: x=x
    print x '≠' y
    1 / 0

(1+2) is 3

```

```
(2+2) is 5
-- out --
4 ≠ 5
-- err --
input:1: division by zero

```

If the operands passed to `is` are not equal (the triple `===` does full vaue comparison),
then `is` prints them out and divides by zero to halt execution.

Next, we will set Ivy’s origin to 0 (instead of the default 1),
meaning `iota` starts counting at 0 and array indexes start at 0,
and then we will define `seq x y`, which returns the list of integers \[x,y\].

```
)origin 0

# seq x y = (x x+1 x+2 ... y)
op seq (x y) = x + iota 1+y-x

(seq -2 4) is -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4

```

Now we are ready to start attacking our problem, which is to prove that for a given 𝑝𝑚, b, and m,
for all x, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚=x·𝑝𝑚mod2b+m≥2b+1,
implying 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2,
at which point we can use Lemma 4.

We will proceed in two steps, loosely following an approach by
Vern Paxson and Tim Peters (the “ [Related Work](#related)” section explains the differences).
The first step is to solve the “modular search” problem of finding the minimum x≥0 (the “first” x)
such that x·cmodm∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].
The second step is to use that solution to solve the “modular minimum” problem of
finding an x in a given range that minimizes x·cmodm.

## [Modular Search](\#modfirst)

Given constants c, m, 𝑙𝑜, and _hi_, we want to find the minimum x≥0 (the “first” x) such that x·cmodm∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].
This is an old programming contest problem, and I am not sure whether it has a formal name.
There are multiple ways to derive a GCD-like efficient solution.
The following explanation, based on [one by David Wärn](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/90690?#comment-791032),
is the simplest I am aware of.

Here is a correct O(m) iterative algorithm:

```
op modfirst (c m lo hi) =
    xr x cx mx = 0 0 1 0
    :while 1
        # (A) xr ≤ hi but perhaps xr < lo.
        :while xr < lo
            xr x = xr x + c cx
        :end
        xr <= hi: x
        # (B) xr - c < lo ≤ hi < xr
        :while xr > hi
            xr x = xr x + (-m) mx
        :end
        lo <= xr: x
        # (C) xr < lo ≤ hi < xr + m
        x >= m: -1
    :end

```

The algorithm walks x forward from 1, maintaining 𝑥𝑟=x·cmodm:

- When 𝑥𝑟 is too small, it adds c to 𝑥𝑟 and increments x (cx=1).

- When 𝑥𝑟 is too large, it subtracts m from 𝑥𝑟 and leaves x unchanged (mx=0).

- When x reaches m, it gives up: there is no answer.

This loop is easily verified to be correct:

- It starts with x=0 and considers successive x one at a time.

- While doing that, it maintains 𝑥𝑟 correctly:

  - If 𝑥𝑟 is too small, we _must_ add a c (and increment x).

  - If 𝑥𝑟 is too large, we _must_ subtract an m (and leave x alone).
- If 𝑥𝑟∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\], it notices and stops.

The only problem with this `modfirst` is that it is unbearably slow,
but we can speed it up.

At (A), xr≤hi,
established by the initial xr=0 or by the end of the previous iteration.

At (B), 𝑥𝑟−c<𝑙𝑜≤_hi_<𝑥𝑟.
Because 𝑥𝑟−c<𝑙𝑜, subtracting m≥c will
make 𝑥𝑟 too small; that will always be followed by at least
⌊m/c⌋ additions of c.
So we might as well replace m with −m+c·⌊m/c⌋,
speeding future trials.
We will also have to update 𝑚𝑥, to make sure x is maintained correctly.

At (C),
𝑥𝑟≤_hi_<𝑥𝑟+m,
and by a similar argument, we might as well replace
c with c−m·⌊c/m⌋,
updating 𝑐𝑥 as well.

Making both changes to our code, we get:

```
op modfirst (c m lo hi) =
    xr x cx mx = 0 0 1 0
    :while 1
        # (A) xr ≤ hi but perhaps xr < lo.
        :while xr < lo
            xr x = xr x + c cx
        :end
        xr <= hi: x
        # (B) xr - c < lo ≤ hi < xr
        m mx = m mx + (-c) cx * floor m/c
        m == 0: -1
        :while xr > hi
            xr x = xr x + (-m) mx
        :end
        lo <= xr: x
        c cx = c cx + (-m) mx * floor c/m
        c == 0: -1
        # (C) xr < lo ≤ hi < xr+m
    :end

```

Notice that the loop is iterating (among other things)
m=mmodc and c=cmodm,
the same as Euclid’s GCD algorithm,
so O(logc) iterations will zero c or m.
The old test for x≥m (made incorrect by modifiying m)
is replaced by checking for c or m becoming zero.

Finally, we should optimize away the small `while` loops by calculating how many times each will be executed:

```
op modfirst (c m lo hi) =
    xr x cx mx = 0 0 1 0
    :while 1
        # (A) xr ≤ hi but perhaps xr < lo.
        xr x = xr x + c cx * ceil (0 max lo-xr)/c
        xr <= hi: x
        # (B) xr - c < lo ≤ hi < xr
        m mx = m mx + (-c) cx * floor m/c
        m == 0: -1
        xr x = xr x + (-m) mx * ceil (0 max xr-hi)/m
        lo <= xr: x
        c cx = c cx + (-m) mx * floor c/m
        c == 0: -1
        # (C) xr < lo ≤ hi < xr+m
    :end

```

Each iteration of the outer `while` loop is now O(1),
and the loop runs at most O(logc) times,
giving a total time of O(logc),
dramatically better than the old O(m).

We can reformat the code to highlight the regular structure:

```
op modfirst (c m lo hi) =
    xr x cx mx = 0 0 1 0
    :while 1
        xr x  = xr x  +   c  cx * ceil (0 max lo-xr)/c ; xr <= hi : x
        m  mx = m  mx + (-c) cx * floor m/c            ; m == 0   : -1
        xr x  = xr x  + (-m) mx * ceil (0 max xr-hi)/m ; lo <= xr : x
        c  cx = c  cx + (-m) mx * floor c/m            ; c == 0   : -1
    :end

(modfirst 13 256 1 5) is 20   # 20*13 mod 256 = 4 ∈ [1, 5]
(modfirst 14 256 1 1) is -1   # impossible

```

We can also check that `modfirst` finds the exact answer from case 2,
namely powers of five zeroing out the middle.

```
(modfirst (pm -3) (2**128) 1 (2**64)) is 125
spaced hex 125 * (pm -3)
-- out --
0x40 0000000000000000 0000000000000042

```

[**Modular Minimization**](#modular_minimization)

Now we can solve the problem of finding the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥,𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛\] that minimizes x·cmodm.

Define the notation xR=x·cmodm (the “residue” of x).
We can construct x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] with minimal xR with the following greedy algorithm.

1. Start with x=𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛.

2. Find the first y∈\[x+1,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] such that yR<xR.

3. If no such y exists, return x.

4. Set x=y.

5. Go to step 2.

The algorithm finds the right answer, because it starts at 𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛 and then steps through
every succesively better answer along the way to 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥.
The algorithm terminates because every search is finite and every step moves x forward by at least 1.
The only detail remaining is how to implement step 2.

For any x and y, (xR−yR)modm=(x−y)R, because multiplication distributes over subtraction.
Call that the _subtraction lemma_.

Finding the first y∈\[x+1,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] with yR<xR
is equivalent to finding the first d∈\[1,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥−x\] with (x+d)R<xR.
By the subtraction lemma, dR=((x+d)R−xR)modm,
so we are looking for the first d≥1 with dR∈\[m−xR,m−1\].
That’s what `modfirst` does, except it searches d≥0.
But 0R=0 and we will only search for 𝑙𝑜≥1, so
`modfirst` can safely start its search at 0.

Note that if dR∈\[m−(x+d)R,m−1\], the next iteration will choose the same d—any better answer would have been an answer to the original search.
So after finding d, we should add it to x as many times as we can.

The full algorithm is then:

1. Start with x=𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛.

2. Use `modfirst` to find the first d≥0 such that dR∈\[m−xR,m−1\].

3. If no d exists or x+d>𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥, stop and return x. Otherwise continue.

4. Let s=m−dR, the number we are effectively subtracting from xR.

5. Let n be the smaller of ⌊(𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥−x)/d⌋ (the most times we can add d to x
   before exceeding our limit) and ⌊xR/s⌋ (the most times we can subtract s from xR
   before wrapping around).

6. Set x=x+d·n.

7. Go to step 2.

In Ivy, that algorithm is:

```
op modmin (xmin xmax c m) =
    x = xmin
    :while 1
        xr = (x*c) mod m
        d = modfirst c m, m - xr 1
        (d < 0) or (x+d) > xmax: x
        s = m - (d*c) mod m
        x = x + d * floor ((xmax-x)/d) min xr/s
    :end

(modmin 10 25 13 255) is 20

```

The running time of `modmin` depends on what limits n.
If n is limited by (𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥−x)/d
then the next iteration will not find a usable d,
since any future d would have to be bigger than the one we just found,
and there won’t be room to add it.
On the other hand, if n is limited by xR/s,
then it means we reduced xR at least by half.
That limits the number of iterations to log2m,
and since `modfirst` is O(logm), `modmin` is
O(log2m).

The subtraction lemma and `modfirst` let us build other useful operations too.
One obvious variant of `modmin` is `modmax`, which finds the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that maximizes xR
and also runs in O(log2m).

We can extend `modmin` to minimize xR≥𝑙𝑜 instead,
by stepping to the first xR≥𝑙𝑜 before looking for improvements:

```
op modminge (xmin xmax c m lo) =
    x = xmin
    :if (xr = (x*c) mod m) < lo
        d = modfirst c m (lo-xr) ((m-1)-xr)
        d < 0: :ret -1
        x = x + d
    :end
    :while 1
        xr = (x*c) mod m
        d = modfirst c m (m-(xr-lo)) (m-1)
        (d < 0) or (x+d) > xmax: x
        s = m - (d*c) mod m
        x = x + d * floor ((xmax-x)/d) min (xr-lo)/s
    :end

op modmin (xmin xmax c m) = modminge xmin xmax c m 0

(modmin 10 25 13 255) is 20
(modminge 10 25 13 255 6) is 21
(modminge 1 20 13 255 6) is 1
(modminge 10 20 255 255 1) is -1

```

We can also invert the search to produce `modmax` and `modmaxle`:

```
op modmaxle (xmin xmax c m hi) =
    x = xmin
    :if (xr = (x*c) mod m) > hi
        d = modfirst c m (m-xr) ((m-xr)+hi)
        d < 0: :ret -1
        x = x + d
    :end
    :while 1
        xr = (x*c) mod m
        d = modfirst c m 1 (hi-xr)
        (d < 0) or (x+d) > xmax: x
        s = (d*c) mod m
        x = x + d * floor ((xmax-x)/d) min (hi-xr)/s
    :end

op modmax (xmin xmax c m) = modmaxle xmin xmax c m (m-1)

(modmax 10 25 13 255) is 19
(modmaxle 10 25 13 255 200) is 15

```

Another variant is `modfind`, which finds the first x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] such that xR∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].
It doesn’t need a loop at all:

```
op modfind (xmin xmax c m lo hi) =
    x = xmin
    xr = (x*c) mod m
    (lo <= xr) and xr <= hi: x
    d = modfirst c m, (lo hi - xr) mod m
    (d < 0) or (x+d) > xmax: -1
    x+d

(modfind 21 100 13 256 1 10) is 40

```

We can also build `modfindall`, which finds all the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] such that xR∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].
Because there might be a very large number, it stops after finding the first 100.

```
op modfindall (xmin xmax c m lo hi) =
    all = ()
    :while 1
        x = modfind xmin xmax c m lo hi
        x < 0: all
        all = all, x
        (count all) >= 100: all
        xmin = x+1
    :end

(modfindall 21 100 13 256 1 10) is 40 79 99

```

Because `modfind` and `modfindall` both call `modfind` O(1) times,
they both run in O(logm) time.

## [Modular Proof](\#modular_proof)

Now we are ready to analyze individual powers.

For a given 𝑝𝑚, b, and m,
we want to verify that for all x∈\[2b−1,2b),
we have 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≥2,
or equivalently, 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚=x·𝑝𝑚mod2b+m≥2b+1.
We can use either `modmin` or `modfind` to do this.
Let’s use `modmin`, so we can show how close we came to
failing.

We’ll start with a function `check1` to check a single power,
and `show1` to format its result:

```
# (b m) check1 p returns (p pm x middle fail) where pm is (pm p).
# If there is a counterexample to p, x is the first one,
# middle is (x*pm)'s middle bits, and fail is 1.
# If there is no counterexample, x middle fail are 0 0 0.
op (b m) check1 p =
    x = modmin (2**b-1) ((2**b)-1) (pm p) (2**b+m)
    middle = ((x * pm p) mod 2**b+m) >> b
    p (pm p) x middle (middle < 2)

# show1 formats the result of check1.
op show1 (p pm x middle fail) =
    p (hex pm) (hex x) (hex middle) ('.❌'[fail])

show1 64 64 check1 200
-- out --
200 0xa738c6bebb12d16cb428f8ac016561dc 0xffe389b3cdb6c3d0 0x34 .

```

For p=200, no 64-bit input produces a 64-bit middle less than 2.

On the other hand, for p=−1, we can verify that `check1` finds a multiple of 5 that zeroes the middle:

```
show1 64 64 check1 -1
-- out --
-1 0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccd 0x8000000000000002 0x0 ❌

```

Let’s check more than one power, gathering the results into a matrix:

```
op (b m) check ps = mix b m check1@ ps
op show table = mix show1@ table

show 64 64 check seq 25 35
-- out --

Now let’s write code to show just the start and end of a table,
to avoid very long outputs:

```
op short table =
    (count table) <= 15: table
    (5 take table) ,% ((count table[0]) rho box '...') ,% (-5 take table)

short show 64 64 check seq 25 95
-- out --

 95 0xbfc2ef456ae276e89e3fedd8c321a67f 0xa674a3e92810fb84 0x0   ❌

```

We can see that most powers are problematic for b=64, m=64,
which is why we’re not trying to prove that general case.

Let’s make it possible to filter the table down to just the bad powers:

```
op sel x = x sel iota count x
op bad table = table[sel table[;4] != 0]

short show bad 64 64 check seq -400 400

 400 0xda763fc8cb9ff9e58e67937de0bbe1c7 0x8598a4df299005e0 0x0   ❌

```

Now we have everything we need. Let’s write a function to try to prove
that `scale` is correct for a given b and m.

```
op prove (b m) =
    table = bad b m check (seq -400 -28), (seq 28 400)
    what = 'b=', (text b), ' m=', (text m), ' t=', (text 127-m), '+½'
    (count table) == 0: print '✅ proved   ' what
    print '❌ disproved' what
    print short show table

```

This function builds a table of all the bad powers for b,m.
If the table is empty, it prints that the settings have been proved.
If not, it prints that the settings are unproven
and prints some of the questionable powers.

If we try to prove 64,64, we get many unproven powers.

```

For printing, we need to prove b=55,m=66.

[**Bonus: 64-bit Input, 64-bit Output?**](#bonus)

We don’t need full 64-bit input and 64-bit output, but if we did,
there is a way to make it work at only a minor performance cost.
It turns out that for 64-bit input and 64-bit output,
for any given p, considering all the inputs x that cause 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0,
either all the middles overflowed or none of them did.
So we can use a lookup table to decide how to interpret 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0.

The implementation steps would be:

1. Note that the proofs remain valid without 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

2. Don’t make use of the 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1 optimization in the `uscale` implementation.

3. When p is large, force the sticky bit to 1
   instead of trying to compute it from 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒.

4. When 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0 for a large p, consult a table of hint bits
   indexed by p to decide whether 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 has overflowed.
   If so, decrement 𝑡𝑜𝑝.

Here is a proof that this works.

First, define `topdiff` which computes the difference between 𝑡𝑜𝑝 and 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ for a given b,m,p.

```
# topdiff computes top - topℝ.
op (b m p) topdiff x =
    top = (x * pm p) >> b+m
    topℝ = (floor x * (10**p) / 2**pe p) >> b+m
    top - topℝ

```

Next, define `hint`, which is like `check1`
in that it looks for counterexamples.
When it finds counterexamples, it computes `topdiff`
for each one and reports whether
they all match, and if so what their value is.

```
# (b m) hint p returns (p pm x middle fail) where pm is (pm p).
# If there is a counterexample to p, x is the first one,
# middle is (x*pm)'s middle bits, and fail is 1, 2, or 3:
#   1 if all counterexamples have top = topR
#   2 if all counterexamples have have top = topR+1
#   3 if both kinds of counterexamples exist or other counterexamples exist
# If there is no counterexample, x middle fail are 0 0 0.
op (b m) hint p =
    x = modmin (2**b-1) ((2**b)-1) (pm p) (2**b+m)
    middle = ((x * pm p) mod 2**b+m) >> b
    middle >= 1: p (pm p) x middle 0
    all = modfindall (2**b-1) ((2**b)-1) (pm p) (2**b+m) 0 ((2**b)-1)
    diffs = b m p topdiff@ all
    equal = or/ diffs == 0
    carry = or/ diffs == 1
    other = ((count all) >= 100) or or/ (diffs != 0) and (diffs != 1)
    p (pm p) x middle ((1*equal)|(2*carry)|(3*other))

```

Finally, define `hints`, which is like `show check`.
It gets the hint results for all large p and
prints a summary of how many were in four categories:
no hints needed, all hints 0, all hints 1, mixed hints.

```
op hints (b m) =
    table = mix b m hint@ (seq -400 -28), (seq 28 400)
    (box 'b=', (text b), ' m=', (text m)), (+/ mix table[;4] ==@ iota 4)

```

Now we can try b=64,m=64:

```
hints 64 64
-- out --
b=64 m=64 452 184 110 0

```

The output says that 452 powers don’t need hints,
184 need a hint that 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ=𝑡𝑜𝑝,
and 110 need a hint that 𝑡𝑜𝑝ℝ=𝑡𝑜𝑝−1.
Crucially, 0 need conflicting hints,
so the hinted algorithm works for b=64,m=64.

Of course, that leaves 64 top bits, and since one bit is the ½ bit,
this is technically only a 63-bit result.
(If you only needed a truncated 64-bit result instead of a rounded one,
you could use e−1 and
read the ½ bit as the final bit of truncated result.)

It turns out that hints are not enough to get a full 64 bits plus a ½ bit,
which would leave a 63-bit middle.
In that case, there turn out to be 63 powers where 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=0 is ambiguous:

```
hints 64 63
-- out --
b=64 m=63 241 283 159 63

```

However, if you only have 63 bits of input, then you can have the full 64-bit output:

```
hints 63 64
-- out --
b=63 m=64 601 86 59 0

```

[**Completed Proof**](#completed_proof)

**Theorem 1**. For the cases used in the printing and parsing algorithms, namely p∈\[−400,400\] with (printing) b≤55,m≥66 and (parsing) b≤64,m≥73, Scale is correct and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

_Proof_. We proved these five cases:

- [Lemma 3](#lemma3). For exact results, Scale computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

- [Lemma 7](#lemma7). For inexact results and p∈\[0,27\] and b≤64, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

- [Lemma 8](#lemma8). For inexact results, p∈\[−27,−1\], and b≤64, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

- [Lemma 9](#lemma9). For p∈\[−400,−28\]∪\[28,400\], b≤55, and m≥66, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.

- [Lemma 10](#lemma10). For p∈\[−400,−28\]∪\[28,400\], b≤64, and m≥73, Scale(x,e,p) computes uscale(x,e,p) and 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒≠1.


The result follows directly from these. ∎

[**A Simpler Proof**](#simpler_proof)

The proof we just finished is the most precise analysis we can do.
It enables tricks like the hint table for 64-bit input and 64-bit output.
However, for printing and parsing, we don’t need to be quite that precise.
We can reduce the four inexact cases to two
by analyzing the exact 𝑝𝑚ℝ values instead of our
rounded 𝑝𝑚 values.
We will show that the spacing around the exact integer
results is wide enough that
all the non-exact integers can’t have middles near 0 or 2m.
The idea of proving a minimal spacing around the exact integer results
is due to Michel Hack,
although the proof is new.

Specifically, we can use the same machinery we just built to prove that
𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ∈\[2,2m+2\] for
inexact results with p∈\[−400,400\],
eliminating the need for [Lemmas 7 and 8](#lemma7) by
generalizing [Lemmas 9 and 10](#lemma9).
To do that, we analyze the non-zero results
of x·𝑝𝑚ℝmod2b+m.
(If that expression is zero, the result is exact,
and we are only analyzing the inexact case.)

Let’s start by defining `gcd` and `pmR`, which returns `pn pd`
such that 𝑝𝑚ℝ=𝑝𝑛/𝑝𝑑.

```
op x gcd y =
    not x*y: x+y
    x > y: (x mod y) gcd y
    x <= y: x gcd (y mod x)

(15 gcd 40) is 5

```

```
op pmR p =
    e = pe p
    num = (10**(0 max p)) * (2**-(0 min e))
    denom = (10**-(0 min p)) * (2**(0 max e))
    num denom / num gcd denom

(pmR -5) is (2**139) (5**5)

```

Let’s also define a helper `zlog` that is like log2\|x\|
except that `zlog 0` is 0.

```
op zlog x =
    x == 0: 0
    2 log abs x

(zlog 4) is 2
(zlog 0) is 0

```

Now we can write an exact version of `check1`.
We want to analyze x·𝑝𝑚ℝmod2b+m,
but to use integers, instead we analyze
xR=x·𝑝𝑛mod𝑝𝑑·2b+m.
We find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] with minimal xR>0
and the y∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] with maximal yR.
Then we convert those to 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 values by
dividing by 𝑝𝑑·2b.

```
op (b m) check1R p =
    pn pd = pmR p
    xmin = 2**b-1
    xmax = (2**b)-1
    M = pd * 2**b+m
    x = modminge xmin xmax pn M 1
    x < 0: p 0 0 0 0
    y = modmax xmin xmax pn M
    xmiddle ymiddle = float ((x y * pn) mod M) / pd * 2**b
    p x y xmiddle ((xmiddle < 2) or (ymiddle > M-2))

op (b m) checkR ps = mix b m check1R@ ps

[**Related Work**](#related_work)

Parts of this proof have been put together in different ways
for other purposes before, most notably to prove that
exact _truncated_ scaling can be implemented using 128-bit mantissas
in floating-point parsing and printing algorithms.
This section traces the history of the ideas as best I have been able
to determine it.
In these summaries, I am using the terminology and
notation of this post—such as top, middle, bottom,
xR and 𝑝𝑚ℝ—for consistency and ease of understanding.
Those terms and notations do not appear in the actual related work.

This section is concerned with the proof methods in these papers
and only touches on the actual algorithms to the extent that they
are relevant to what was proved. The [main post’s related work](fp#related)
discusses the algorithms in more detail.

### [Paxson 1991](\#paxson_1991)

→ Vern Paxson, “ [A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal-Binary Conversion](https://www.icir.org/vern/papers/testbase-report.pdf)”, class paper 1991.

The earliest work that I have found that linked modular minimization
to floating-point conversions
is Paxson’s 1991 paper, already mentioned above and
written for one of William Kahan’s graduate classes.
Paxson credits Tim Peters
for the modular minimization algorithms,
citing an email discussion on `validgh!numeric-interest@uunet.uu.net` in April 1991:

> In the following section we derive a modular
> equation which if minimized produces especially difficult conversion inputs; those
> that lie as close as possible to exactly half way between two representable outputs.
> We then develop the theoretical framework for demonstrating the correctness of
> two algorithms developed by Tim Peters for solving such a modular minimization
> problem in O(log(N)) time.

I have been unable to find copies of the `numeric-interest` email discussion.

Peters broke down the minimization problem into a two step process,
which I followed in this proof.
Using this post’s notation (xR=x·cmodm),
the two steps in Paxson’s paper (with two algorithms each) are:

- _FirstModBelow_: Find the first x≥0 with xR≤_hi_.

  _FirstModAbove_: Find the first x≥0 with xR≥𝑙𝑜.

- _ModMin_: Find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that maximizes xR≤_hi_.

  _ModMax_: Find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that minimizes xR≥𝑙𝑜.

(The names _ModMin_ and _ModMax_ seem inverted from their definitions,
but perhaps “Min” refers to finding something below a limit and “Max”
to finding something above a limit.
They are certainly inverted from this post’s usage.)

In contrast, this post’s algorithms are;

- `modfirst`: Find the first x≥0 with xR∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].

- `modfind`: Find the first x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] with xR∈\[𝑙𝑜,_hi_\].

- `modmin`: Find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that minimizes xR.

- `modminge`: Find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that minimizes xR≥𝑙𝑜.

- `modmax`: Find the x∈\[𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥\] that maximizes xR.

It is possible to use `modfirst` to implement
Paxson’s _FirstModBelow_ and _FirstModAbove_, and vice versa,
so they are equivalent in power.

In Paxson’s paper,
the implementation and correctness of _FirstModBelow_ and _FirstModAbove_
depend on computing the convergents of continued fractions of c/m
and proving properties about them.
Specifically, the result of _FirstModBelow_ must be the denominator of a
convergent or semiconvergent in the continued fraction for c/m,
so it suffices to find the last even convergent p2i/q2i such that (q2i)R>_hi_
but (q2(i+1))R<_hi_,
and then
compute the correct q2i+k·q2i+1
by looking at how much (q2i+1)R subtracts from (q2i)R and
subtracting it just enough times.
I had resigned myself to implementing this approach before I found
David Wärn’s simpler proof of the direct GCD-like approach in `modfirst`.
The intermediate steps in GCD(p,q) are exactly the continued fraction representation of p/q,
so it is not surprising that both GCDs and
continued fractions can be used
for modular search.

No matter how `modfirst` is implemented,
the critical insight is Peters’s observaton
that “find the first” is a good building block for
the more sophisticated searches.

Paxson’s _ModMin_/ _ModMax_ are tailored to a
slightly different problem than we are solving.
Instead of analyzing a particular multiplicative constant
(a specific 𝑝𝑚 or 𝑝𝑚ℝ value),
Paxson is looking directly for decimal numbers as close as
possible to midpoints between binary floating-point numbers and vice versa.
That means finding xR near m/2 modulo m.
This post’s proof is concerned with those values as well,
but also the ones near integers. So we look for xR
near zero modulo 2m, which is a little simpler.
Paxson couldn’t use that because it would find numbers
near zero modulo m in addition to numbers near m/2 modulo m.
The former are especially easy to round, so Paxson needs to exclude them.
(In contrast, numbers near zero modulo m are a problem for Scale
because the caller might want to take their floor or ceiling.)

### [Hanson 1997](\#hanson_1997)

→ Kenton Hanson, “ [Economical Correctly Rounded Binary Decimal Conversions](https://web.archive.org/web/20000607192440/http://www.dnai.com/~khanson/ECRBDC.html)”, published online 1997.

The next analysis of floating-point rounding difficulty that I found
is a paper published on the web by Kenton Hanson in 1997,
reporting work done earlier at Apple Computer using a [Macintosh Quadra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra),
which perhaps dates it to the early 1990s.
Hanson’s web site is down and email to the address on the paper bounces. The link above is to a copy on the Internet Archive, but it omits the figures,
which seem crucial to fully understanding the paper.

Hanson identified patterns that can be exploited to grow short “hard”
conversions into longer ones.
Then he used those longest hard conversions as the basis for an argument
that conversion works correctly for all conversions up to that length:
“Once this worst case is determined we have shown how we can
guarantee correct conversions using arithmetic that is slightly
more than double the precision of the target destinations.”

Hanson focused on 113-bit floating-point numbers, using 256-bit mantissas
for scaling, and only rounding conversions.
I expect that his approach would have worked for
proving that 53-bit floating-point
numbers can be converted with 128-bit mantissas,
but I have not reconstructed it and confirmed that.

### [Hack 2004](\#hack_2004)

→ Gordon Slishman, “ [Fast and Perfectly Rounding Decimal/Hexadecimal Conversions](https://mp7.watson.ibm.com/f55d084fadf9ae59852574ab0058f749.html)”, IBM Research Report, April 1990.

→ P.H. Abbott _et al._, “ [Architecture and software support in IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Servers for IEEE Floating-Point arithmetic](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5389154)”, _IBM Journal of Research and Development_, September 1999.

→ Michel Hack, “ [On Intermediate Precision Required for Correctly-Rounding Decimal-to-Binary Floating-Point Conversion](https://dominoweb.draco.res.ibm.com/reports/rc23203.pdf)”, IBM Technical Paper, 2004.

The next similar discovery appears to be Hack’s 2004 work at IBM.

In 1990, Slishman had published a conversion method that used
floating-point approximations, like in this post.
Slishman used a 16-bit middle and recognized that
a non- `0xFFFF` 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 implied the correctness of the top section.
His algorithm fell back to a slow bignum implementation
when 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 was `0xFFFF` and carry error could not be ruled out (approximately 1/216 of the time).
(Hack defined 𝑝𝑚 to be a floor instead of a ceiling, so the error condition
is inverted from ours.)

In 1999, Abbott _et al._ (including Hack) published a comprehensive article
about the S/390’s new support for IEEE floating-point
(as opposed to its [IBM hexadecimal floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_hexadecimal_floating-point)).
In that article, they observed (like Paxson) that difficult numbers
can be generated by using continued fraction expansion of 𝑝𝑚ℝ values.
They also observed that bounding the size of the
continued fraction expansion would bound the precision required,
potentially leading to bignum-free conversions.

Following publication of that article, Alan Stern initiated “a spirited e-mail exchange
during the spring of 2000” and “pointed out that the hints at improvement
mentioned in that article were still too conservative.”
As a result of that exchange, Hack launched a renewed investigation
of the error behavior, leading to the 2004 technical report.

Hack’s report only addresses decimal-to-binary (parsing) with a fixed-length input,
not binary-to-decimal (printing),
even though the comments in the 1999 article were about both directions
and the techniques would apply equally well to binary-to-decimal.

In the terminology of this post,
Hack proved that analysis of the continued fraction
for a specific 𝑝𝑚ℝ can establish a lower bound L
such that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ<L if and only if
𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒ℝ\|\|𝑏𝑜𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑚ℝ=0.
For an n-digit decimal input,
L=1/(10n·(k+2)) where k is the maximum partial quotient
in the continued fraction expansion of 𝑝𝑚ℝ
following certain convergents.

Hack summarizes:

> Using Continued Fraction expansions of a set of ratios of powers of two and five
> we can derive tight bounds on the intermediate precision required to
> perform correctly-rounding floating-point conversion:
> it is the sum of three components: the number of bits in the target format,

I admit to discomfort with both Paxson’s and Hack’s
use of continued fraction analysis.
The math is subtle, and it seems easy to overlook a relevant case.
For example Paxson needs semiconvergents for _FirstModBelow_
but Hack does not explicitly mention them.
Even though I trust that both Paxson’s and Hack’s results are correct,
I do not trust myself to adapt them to new contexts
without making unjustified mathematical assumptions.
In contrast, the explicit GCD-like algorithm in `modfirst`
and explicit searches based on it seem far less
sophisticated and less error-prone to adapt.

### [Giulietti 2018](\#giulietti_2018)

→ Raffaello Giulietti, “ [The Schubfach way to render doubles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IEeATSVnEE6TkrHlCYNY2GjaraBjOT4f/edit),” published online, 2018, revised 2021.

→ Dmitry Nadhezin, [nadezhin/verify-todec GitHub repository](https://github.com/nadezhin/verify-todec), published online, 2018.

Raffaello Giulietti developed the Schubfach algorithm while working on
[Java bug JDK-4511638](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-4511638),
that `Double.toString` sometimes returned non-shortest results,
most notably ‘9.999999999999999e22’ for 1e23.
Giulietti’s original solution contained a fallback to multiprecision
arithmetic in certain cases,
and he wrote a paper proving the solution’s correctness
(I have been unable to find that original code, nor the first version of the paper,
which was apparently titled “Rendering doubles in Java”.)

Dmitry Nadhezin set out to [formally check the proof](https://github.com/nadezhin/verify-todec/blob/master/README.md) using the ACL2 theorem prover.
During that effort, Giulietti and Nadhezin came across Hack’s 2004 paper
and realized they could remove the multiprecision arithmetic entirely.
Nadhezin adapted Hack’s analysis and proved Giulietti’s entire conversion algorithm
correct using the ACL2 theorem prover.
As part of that proof, Nadhezin proved (and formally verified)
that the spacing around exact integer results that might arise during
Schubfach’s printing algorithm is at least ε=2−64 in either direction
allowing the use of 126-bit 𝑝𝑚 values.
(Using 126 instead of 128 is necessary
because Java has only a signed 64-bit integer type.)

### [Adams 2018](\#adams_2018)

→ Ulf Adams, “ [Ryū: Fast Float-to-String Conversion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3192366.3192369)”, ACM PLDI 2018.

Independent of Giulietti’s work,
Ulf Adams developed a different floating-point printing algorithm named Ryū,
also based on 128-bit (or in Java, 126-bit) 𝑝𝑚 values.
Adams proved the correctness of a computation for
⌊x/10p⌋ using ⌊𝑝𝑚ℝ⌋ for positive p
and ⌈𝑝𝑚ℝ⌉ for negative p.
Doubling x provides the ½ bit,
but Ryū does not compute the sticky bit
as part of that computation.
Instead, Ryū computes an exactness bit
(the inverse of the sticky bit)
by explicitly testing xmod2p=0 for p>0
and xmod5−p=0 for p<0.
The latter is done iteratively, requring
up to 23 64-bit divisions in the worst case.
(It is possible to [reduce this to a single 64-bit multiplication](https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1/src/internal/strconv/math.go#93)
by a constant obtained from table lookup,
but Ryū does not.)

Like any of these proofs,
Adams’s proof of correctness of the truncated result
needs to analyze specific 𝑝𝑚 or 𝑝𝑚ℝ values.
Adams chose to analyze the 𝑝𝑚 values
and defined a function `minmax_euclid`(a,b,M)
that returns the minimum and maximum values of x·amodb for x∈\[0,M′\]
for some M′≥M chosen by the algorithm.
The paper includes a dense page-long proof of the correctness of
`minmax_euclid`, but it must contain a mistake,
since `minmax_euclid` turns out not to be correct.
As one example, Junekey Jeon has pointed out that `minmax_euclid`(3,8,7)
returns a minimum of 1 and maximum of 0.
We can verify this by implementing `minmax_euclid` in Ivy:

Jeon also points out that the trouble begins on the first line of Adams’s proof,
which claims that a≤(−a)modb,
but that is false for a>b/2.
However, the general idea is right, and Adams’s Ryū repository
contains a [more complex and apparently fixed version](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu/blob/6a02945a5abd/src/main/java/info/adams/ryu/analysis/EuclidMinMax.java#L83) of the max
calculation.
Even corrected, the results are loose in two directions: they include x both smaller
and larger than the exact range \[2b−1,2b−1).

In 2020, Jeon published a paper about Grisu-Exact, an exact variation of the Grisu algorithm
without the need for a bignum fallback algorithm.
Jeon relied on Adams’s general proof approach but pointed out the problems
with `minmax_euclid` mentioned in the previous section and supplied a replacement
algorithm and proof of its correctness.

```
op minmax_euclid (a b M) =
    modulo = b
    s u = 1 0
    :while 1
        q = (ceil b/a) - 1
        b1 = b - q*a
        u1 = u + q*s
        :if M < u1
            k = floor (M-u) / s
            :ret a ((modulo - b) + k*a)
        :end
        p = (ceil a/b1) - 1
        a1 = a - p*b1
        s1 = s + p*u1
        :if M < s1
            k = floor (M-s) / u1
            :ret (a-k*b1) (modulo - b1)
        :end
        :if (b1 == b) and (a1 == a)
            :if M < s1 + u1
                :ret a1 (modulo - b1)
            :else
                :ret 0 (modulo - b1)
            :end

In March 2020, Lemire published code for a fast floating-point parser
for up to 19-digit decimal inputs
using a 128-bit 𝑝𝑚, based on an idea by Michael Eisel.
Nigel Tao [blogged about it in 2020](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/eisel-lemire.html)
and Lemire published the algorithm in _Software—Practice and Experience_ in 2021.

As published in 2021, Lemire’s algorithm uses 𝑝𝑚=⌊𝑝𝑚ℝ⌋ and
therefore checks for 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=2m−1 as a sign of possible inexactness.
Upon finding that condition, the algorithm falls back to a bignum-based
implementation.

In 2023, Mushtak and Lemire published a short but dense followup note proving that 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒=2m−1
is impossible, and therefore the fallback check is unnecessary and can be removed.
They address only the specific case of a 64-bit input and 73-bit middle,
making the usual continued fraction arguments to bound the error for non-exact results.

Empirically, Mushtak and Lemire’s computational proof does not generalize to other sizes.
I [downloaded their Python script](https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float/blob/main/script/mushtak_lemire.py) and changed it from analyzing N=m+b=137
to analyze other sizes and observed both false positives and false negatives.
I believe the false negatives are from omitting semiconvergents
(unnecessary for N=137, as proved in their Theorem 2)
and the false positives are from the approach not limiting x
to the range \[2b−1,2b−1).

In 2024, Jeon published Dragonbox, a successor to Grisu-Exact.
Jeon changed from using the corrected `minmax_euclid` implementation
to using a proof based on continued fractions.
Algorithm C.14 (“Finding best rational approximations from below and above”)
is essentially equivalent to Paxson’s algorithms.
Like in Ryū and Grisu-Exact, the proof
only considers the truncated computation ⌊x·2e·10p⌋
and computes an exactness bit separately.

## [Conclusion](\#conclusion)

This post proved that Scale can be implemented
correctly using a fast approximation
that involves only a few word-sized multiplications and shifts.
For printing and parsing of float64 values, computing the top
128 bits of a 64×128-bit multiplication is sufficient.

The fact that float64 conversions require only 128-bit precision
has been known since at least Hanson’s work at Apple in the mid-1990s,
but that work was not widely known and did not include a proof.
Paxson used an exact computational worst case analysis of modular multiplications
to find difficult conversion cases; he did not
bound the precision needed for parsing and printing.
In contrast, Hack, Giulietti and Nadhezin, Adams, Mushtak and Lemire, and Jeon
all derived ways to bound the precision needed for parsing or printing,
but none of them used an exact computational worst case analysis
that generalizes to arbitrary floating-point formats,
and none recognized the commonality between parsing and printing.

The approach in this post, based on Paxson’s general approach
and built upon a modular analysis primitive by David Wärn,
is the first exact analysis that generalizes to arbitrary formats
and handles both parsing and printing.

In this post, I have tried to give credit where credit is due
and to represent others’ work fairly and accurately.
