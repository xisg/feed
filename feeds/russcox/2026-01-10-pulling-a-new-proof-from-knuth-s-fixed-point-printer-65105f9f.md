# Pulling a New Proof from Knuth’s Fixed-Point Printer

[**Introduction**](#introduction)

Donald Knuth wrote his 1989 paper “A Simple Program Whose Proof Isn’t”
as part of a tribute to Edsger Dijkstra on the occasion of Dijkstra’s 60th birthday.
Today’s post is a reply to Knuth’s paper on the occasion of Knuth’s 88th birthday.

In his paper, Knuth posed the problem
of converting 16-bit fixed-point binary fractions to decimal fractions,
aiming for the shortest decimal that converts back to the original 16-bit binary fraction.
Knuth gives a program named _P2_ that leaves digits in the array _d_ and a digit count in _k_:

> _P2_:
>
> _j_ := 0; _s_ := 10 \* _n_ \+ 5; _t_ := 10;
>
> **repeat** **if** _t_ \> 65536 **then** _s_ := _s_ \+ 32768 − ( _t_ **div** 2);
>
> _j_ := _j_ \+ 1; _d_\[ _j_\] = _s_ **div** 65536;
>
> _s_ := 10 \* ( _s_ **mod** 65536); _t_ := 10 \* _t_;
>
> **until** _s_ ≤ _t_;
>
> _k_ := _j_.

Knuth’s goal was to prove _P2_ correct without exhaustive testing,
and he did, but he didn’t consider the proof ‘simple’.
(Since there are only a small finite number of inputs,
Knuth notes that this problem is a counterexample to Djikstra’s remark that
“testing can reveal the presence of errors but not their absence.”
Exhaustive testing would technically prove the program correct,
but Knuth wants a proof that reveals _why_ it works.)

At the end of the paper, Knuth wrote, “So. Is there a better program, or a better proof,
or a better way to solve the problem?”
This post presents what is, in my opinion, a better proof of the correctness of _P2_.
It starts with a simpler program with a trivial direct proof of correctness.
Then it transforms that simpler program into _P2_, step by step,
proving the correctness of each transformation.
The post then considers a few other ways to solve the problem,
including one from a textbook that Knuth probably had within easy reach.
Finally, it concludes with
some reflections on the role of language in shaping our programs and proofs.

## [Problem Statement](\#problem_statement)

Let’s start with a precise definition of the problem.
The input is a fraction f of the form n/216 for some integer n∈\[0,216).
We want to convert f to the shortest accurate correctly rounded decimal form.

- By ‘correctly rounded’ we mean that the decimal is d=⌊f·10p+½⌋/10p—that is, d is f rounded to p digits—for some p.

- By ‘accurate’ we mean that the decimal rounds back exactly:
  ⌊d·216+½⌋/216=f.

- By ‘shortest’ we mean that any shorter correctly rounded decimal ⌊f·10q+½⌋/10q for q<p is not accurate.

(For this problem, Knuth assumes “round half up” behavior,
as opposed to IEEE 754 “round half to even”,
and the rounding equations reflect this.
The answer does not change significantly if we use IEEE rounding instead.)

## [Notation](\#notation)

Next, let’s define some convenient notation.
As usual we will write the fractional part of x
as {x}
and rounding as \[x\]=⌊x+½⌋.
We will also define {x}p, ⌊x⌋p, ⌈x⌉p, and \[x\]p
to be the fractional part, floor, ceiling, and rounding
of x relative to decimal fractions with p digits:

{x}p={x·10p}/10p⌊x⌋p=⌊x·10p⌋/10p⌈x⌉p=⌈x·10p⌉/10p\[x\]p=\[x·10p\]/10p

Using the new notation, the correctly rounded p-digit decimal for f is \[f\]p.

Following Knuth’s paper, this post also uses the notation
\[x..y\] for the interval from x to y, including x and y;
\[x..y) is the half-open interval, which excludes y.

## [Initial Solution](\#initial_solution)

The definitions of ‘accurate’ and ‘correctly rounded’ imply two simple observations,
which we will prove as lemmas.
(In my attempt to avoid accusations of imprecision,
I may well be too pedantic.
Skip the proof of any lemma you think is obviously true.)

**_Accuracy Lemma_**. The accurate decimals are those in the _accuracy interval_\[f−2−17..f+2−17).

_Proof_. This follows immediately from the definition of accurate.

⌊d·216+½⌋/216=f\[definitionofaccurate\]⌊d·216+½⌋=f·216\[multiplyby216\]d·216+½∈f·216+\[0..1)\[domainoffloor;f·216isaninteger\]d·216∈f·216+\[−½..½)\[subtract½\]d∈f+\[−2−17..2−17)\[divideby216\]

We have shown that d being accurate is equivalent to d∈f+\[−2−17..2−17)=\[f−2−17..f+2−17).

**_Five-Digit Lemma_**. The correctly rounded 5-digit decimal d=\[f\]5
sits inside the accuracy interval.

_Proof_.
Intuitively, the accuracy interval has width 2−16 while 5-digit decimals occur at
the narrower spacing 10−5, so at least one such decimal appears inside each accuracy interval.

More precisely,

d=⌊f·105+½⌋/105\[definitionofd\]∈(f·105+½−\[0..1))/105\[rangeoffloor\]=(f−½·10−5..f+½·10−5\]\[simplifying\]⊂\[f−2−17..f+2−17\]\[½·10−5<2−17\]

We have shown that the 5-digit correctly-rounded decimal for f is in the accuracy interval.

The problem statement and these two lemmas
lead to a trivial direct solution:
compute correctly rounded p-digit decimals
for increasing p and return the first accurate one.

We will implement that solution in
[Ivy, an APL-like calculator language](https://robpike.io/ivy).
Ivy has arbitrary-precision rationals and lightweight syntax,
making it a convenient tool for sketching and testing mathematical algorithms,
in the spirit of Iverson’s Turing Award lecture about APL,
“ [Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1283920.1283935).”
Like APL, Ivy uses strict right-to-left operator precedence:
`1+2*3+4` means `(1+(2*(3+4)))`,
and `floor 10 log f` means `floor (10 log f)`.
Operators can be prefix unary like `floor` or infix binary like `log`.
Each of the Ivy displays in this post is executable:
you can edit the code and re-run them by clicking the Play button (“▶️”).
A full introduction to Ivy is beyond the scope of this post;
see [the Ivy demo](https://swtch.com/ivy/demo.html) for more examples.

To start, we need to build a small amount of Ivy scaffolding.
The binary operator `p digits d` splits an integer `d` into `p` digits:

```
op p digits d = (p rho 10) encode d

```

```
3 digits 123
-- out --
1 2 3

```

```
4 digits 123
-- out --
0 1 2 3

```

Next, Ivy already provides ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉,
but we need to define operators for \[x\], \[x\]p, ⌊x⌋p, and ⌈x⌉p.

```
op round x = floor x + 1/2

op p round x = (round x * 10**p) / 10**p
op p floor x = (floor x * 10**p) / 10**p
op p ceil  x = (ceil  x * 10**p) / 10**p

```

(Like APL, Ivy uses strict right-to-left evaluation;
`1/2` is a rational constant literal, not a division.)

Now we can write our trivial solution.

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while 1
        d = p round f
        :if (min <= d) and (d < max)
            :ret p digits d * 10**p
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end

```

[**Initial Proof of Correctness**](#initial_proof_of_correctness)

The correctness of `bin2dec` is simple to prove:

- The implementation of `round` is the mathematical definition of p-digit rounding,
  so the result is correctly rounded.

- By the [Accuracy Lemma](#accuracy), 𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are correctly defined
  for use in the accuracy test 𝑚𝑖𝑛≤d<𝑚𝑎𝑥,
  so the result is accurate.

- The loop considers correctly rounded forms
  of increasing length until finding one that is accurate,
  so the result must be shortest.

- By the [Five-Digit Lemma](#5digit), the loop returns after at most 5 iterations, proving termination.

Therefore `bin2dec` returns the shortest accurate correctly rounded decimal for f.

## [Testing](\#testing)

Knuth’s motivating example was that the decimal 0.4 converted to binary and back
printed as 0.39999 in TeX.
Let’s define a decimal-to-binary converter and check how it handles 0.4.

```
op dec2bin f = (round f * 2**16) / 2**16

```

```
dec2bin 0.4
-- out --
13107/32768

```

```
dec2bin 0.39999
-- out --
13107/32768

```

```
float dec2bin 0.4
-- out --
0.399993896484

```

We can see that both 0.4 and 0.39999 read as 26214/216, or 13107/215 in reduced form.
The `float` operator converts that fraction to an Ivy floating-point value, which Ivy then prints
to a limited number of decimals.
We can see that 0.39999 is the correctly rounded 5-digit form.

Now let’s see how our printer does:

```
bin2dec dec2bin 0.4
-- out --
4

```

It works! And it works for longer fractions as well:

```
bin2dec dec2bin 0.123
-- out --
1 2 3

```

(The values being printed are vectors of digits of the decimal fraction.)

We can also implement Knuth’s solution, to compare against `bin2dec`.

```
op knuthP2 f =
    n = f * 2**16
    s = (10 * n) + 5
    t = 10
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 65536
            s = s + 32768 - t/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s/65536
        s = 10 * (s mod 65536)
        t = 10 * t
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
    :end

```

Compared to Knuth’s original program text,
the variable `d` is now an Ivy vector instead of a fixed-size array,
and the variable `j`, previously the number of entries used in the array,
remains only implicitly as the length of the vector.
The assignment ‘ _j_ := 0’ is now ‘ `d = ()`’, initializing d to the empty vector.
And ‘ _j_ := _j_ \+ 1; _d_\[ _j_\] = _s_ **div** 65536’
is now ‘ `d = d, floor s/65536`’, appending ⌊s/65536⌋ to d.

```
knuthP2 dec2bin 0.4
-- out --
4

```

Now we can use testing to prove the absence of bugs.
We’ll be doing this repeatedly, so we will define `check desc`,
which prints the result of the test next to a description.

```
)origin 0
op check desc =
    all = (iota 2**16) / 2**16
    ok = (bin2dec@ all) === (knuthP2@ all)
    print '❌✅'[ok] desc

check 'initial bin2dec'
-- out --
✅ initial bin2dec

```

In this code, ‘ `)origin 0`’ configures Ivy to make `iota` and array indices start at 0
instead of APL’s usual 1;
`all` is \[0..216)/216, all the 16-bit fractions;
`ok` is a boolean indicating whether `bin2dec` and `knuthP2` return
identical results on all inputs;
and the final line prints an emoji result and the description.

Of course, we want to do more than exhaustively check `knuthP2` against
our provably correct `bin2dec`.
We want to prove directly that the `knuthP2` code is correct.
We will do that by incrementally transforming `bin2dec` into `knuthP2`.

## [Walking Digits](\#walking_digits)

We can start by simplifying the computation of decimals that are
shorter than necessary.
To build an inuition for that, it will help to look at
the accuracy intervals of short decimals.
Here are the intervals for our test case:

```
op show x = (mix 'min ' 'f' 'max'), mix '%.100g' text@ (dec2bin x) + (-1 0 1) * 2**-17

show 0.4
-- out --
min 0.39998626708984375
f   0.399993896484375
max 0.40000152587890625

```

That printed the exact decimal values of
f−2−17 (𝑚𝑖𝑛), f, and f+2−17 (𝑚𝑎𝑥)
for f=dec2bin(0.4)=\[0.4·216\]/216=26214/65536.

Here are a few cases that are longer but still short:

```
show 0.43
-- out --
min 0.42998504638671875
f   0.42999267578125
max 0.43000030517578125

```

```
show 0.432
-- out --
min 0.43199920654296875
f   0.4320068359375
max 0.43201446533203125

```

```
show 0.4321
-- out --
min 0.43209075927734375
f   0.432098388671875
max 0.43210601806640625

```

These displays suggest a new strategy for `bin2dec`:
walk along the digits of these exact decimals until
𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 diverge at the pth decimal place.
At that point, we have found a p-digit decimal between 𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥,
namely ⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p.
That result is obviously accurate and shortest.
It is not obvious that the result is correctly rounded,
but that turns out to be the case for p≤4.
Intuitively, when p is shorter than necessary,
there are fewer p-digit decimals than 16-bit binary fractions,
so each accuracy interval can contain at most one decimal.
When the accuracy interval does contain a decimal,
that decimal must be both \[f\]p and ⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p.
For the full-length case p=5, the accuracy interval can contain
multiple p-digit decimals,
so \[f\]p and ⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p may differ.

We will prove that now.

**_Rounding Lemma_**. For p≤4, the accuracy interval contains at most one p-digit decimal.
If it does contain one,
that decimal is \[f\]p,
the correctly rounded p-digit decimal for f.

_Proof_. By the definition of rounding, we know that d=\[f\]p is _at most_ ½·10−p away from f
and that any other p-digit decimal must be _at least_ ½·10−p away from f.
Since ½·10−p>2−17, those other decimals cannot be in the accuracy interval:
the rounded d is the only possible option.
(The rounded d may or may not itself be in the accuracy interval,
but it’s our best and only hope. If it isn’t there, no p-digit decimal is.)

**_Endpoint Lemma_**. The endpoints f±2−17 of the accuracy interval
are never p-digit decimals for p≤5,
nor are they shortest accurate correctly rounded decimals.

_Proof_.
Because f=n·2−16 for some integer n, f±2−17=(2n±1)·2−17.
If an endpoint were a decimal of 5 digits or fewer,
it would be an integer multiple of 10−5,
but (2n±1)·2−17/10−5=((2n±1)·55)·2−12 is an odd number divided by 212,
which cannot be an integer.
The contradiction proves that the endpoints cannot be exact decimals of 5 digits or fewer.
By the [Five-Digit Lemma](#5digit), the endpoints must also not be
shortest accurate correctly rounded decimals.

**_Truncating Lemma_**. For p≤4, the accuracy interval contains at most one p-digit decimal.
If it does contain one, that decimal is
⌊f+2−17⌋p, the p-digit truncation of the interval’s upper endpoint.

_Proof_. The [Rounding Lemma](#rounding) established that the accuracy interval contains at most one p-digit decimal.

Let 𝑚𝑖𝑛=f−2−17 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥=f+2−17, so the accuracy interval is \[𝑚𝑖𝑛..𝑚𝑎𝑥).
Any p-digit decimal in that interval must also be in the narrower interval using p-digit endpoints

\[⌈𝑚𝑖𝑛⌉p..⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p\].

This new interval is strictly narrower because, by the [Endpoint Lemma](#endpoint), 𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are not themselves p-digit decimals.

If ⌈𝑚𝑖𝑛⌉p>⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p, the interval is empty.
Otherwise, it clearly contains its upper endpoint, proving the lemma.

The [Rounding Lemma](#rounding) and [Truncating Lemma](#truncating) combine
to prove that when p≤4 and the accuracy interval contains any p-digit decimal,
then it contains the single p-digit decimal

⌈f−2−17⌉p=\[f2−17\]p=⌊f+2−17⌋p.

The original `bin2dec` was written like this:

```
)op bin2dec
-- out --
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while 1
        d = p round f
        :if (min <= d) and (d < max)
            :ret p digits d * 10**p
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end

```

By the [Five-Digit Lemma](#5digit), we know that the loop terminates
in the fifth iteration, if not before.
Let’s move that fifth iteration down after the loop,
written as an unconditional return.
That leaves the loop body handling only the short conversions:

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while p <= 4
        d = p round f
        :if (min <= d) and (d < max)
            :ret p digits d * 10**p
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end
    p digits (p round f) * 10**p

```

```
check 'rounding bin2dec refactored'
-- out --
✅ rounding bin2dec refactored

```

Next we can apply the [Truncating Lemma](#truncating) to the loop body:

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while p <= 4
        :if (p ceil min) <= (p floor max)
            :ret p digits (p floor max) * 10**p
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end
    p digits (p round f) * 10**p

```

```
check 'truncating bin2dec'
-- out --
✅ truncating bin2dec

```

This version of `bin2dec` is much closer to _P2_,
although not yet visibly so.

## [Premultiplication](\#premultiplication)

Next we need to apply a basic optimization.
The expressions `p ceil min`, `p trunc max`,
and `p round f` hide repeated multiplication
and division by 10p.
We can avoid those by multiplying 𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑚𝑎𝑥, and f by 10 on each iteration
instead.

As an intermediate step, let’s write the multiplications by 10p explicitly,
changing `p ceil x` to `(ceil x * 10**p) / 10**p` and so on:

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while p <= 4
        :if ((ceil min * 10**p) / 10**p) <= ((floor max * 10**p) / 10**p)
            :ret p digits ((floor max * 10**p) / 10**p) * 10**p
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end
    p digits ((round f * 10**p) / 10**p) * 10**p

```

```
check 'multiplied bin2dec'
-- out --
✅ multiplied bin2dec

```

Next, we can simplify away all the divisions by 10p.
In the comparison,
not dividing both sides by 10p
leaves the result unchanged,
and the other divisions are immediately re-multiplied by 10p.

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    :while p <= 4
        :if (ceil min * 10**p) <= (floor max * 10**p)
            :ret p digits (floor max * 10**p)
        :end
        p = p + 1
    :end
    p digits (round f * 10**p)

```

```
check 'simplified'
-- out --
✅ simplified

```

Finally, we can replace the multiplication by 10p
with multiplying f, 𝑚𝑖𝑛, and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 by 10
each time we increment p:

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    f = 10 * f
    min = 10 * min
    max = 10 * max
    :while p <= 4
        :if (ceil min) <= (floor max)
            :ret p digits floor max
        :end
        p = p + 1
        f = 10 * f
        min = 10 * min
        max = 10 * max
    :end
    p digits round f

```

```
check 'premultiplied'
-- out --
✅ premultiplied

```

[**Collecting Digits**](#collecting_digits)

At this point the only important difference between Knuth’s _P2_
and our current `bin2dec` is that _P2_ computes one digit
per loop iteration instead of computing them all
from a single integer when returning.
As we saw above, `bin2dec` is walking along the
decimal form of 𝑚𝑖𝑛, f, and 𝑚𝑎𝑥
until they diverge,
at which point it can return an answer.
Intuitively, since the walk continues only while
the digits of all decimals in the accuracy interval agree,
it is fine to collect one digit per step along the walk.

To help prove that intuition more formally, we need the following law of floors,
which Knuth also uses.
For all integers a and b with b>0:

⌊⌊x⌋+ab⌋=⌊⌊x+a⌋b⌋.

Now we are ready to prove the necessary lemma.

**_Digit Collection Lemma_**.
Let 𝑚𝑖𝑛=f−2−17 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥=f+2−17.
For p≥1, the p+1-digit decimal ⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p+1 has ⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p as its leading digits:

⌊⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p+1⌋p=⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p.

Furthermore, for p=4, if ⌈𝑚𝑖𝑛⌉p>⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p then the p+1-digit decimal \[f\]p+1 has
⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p as its leading digits:

⌊\[f\]p+1⌋p=⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p.

_Proof_.
For the first half, we can prove the result for any p≥1 and any x≥0, not just x=𝑚𝑎𝑥:

⌊⌊x⌋p+1⌋p=⌊(⌊x·10p+1⌋/10p+1)·10p⌋/10p\[definitionof⌊⌋p+1and⌊⌋p\]=⌊⌊x·10p+1⌋/10⌋/10p\[simplifying\]=⌊x·10p⌋/10p\[lawoffloors\]=⌊x⌋p\[definitionof⌊⌋p\]

For the second half, ⌈𝑚𝑖𝑛⌉p>⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p
expands to ⌈f−2−17⌉p>⌊f+2−17⌋p,
which implies f is 2−17 away in both directions
from an exact p-digit decimal:
2−17≤{f}p<10−p−2−17,
or equivalently 10p·2−17≤{f·10p}<1−10p·2−17.
Note in particular that since 10p·2−17=104·2−17>1/20,
⌊f·10p⌋=⌊f·10p+1/20⌋=⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥·10p⌋.

Now:

⌊\[f\]p+1⌋p=⌊\[f\]p+1·10p⌋/10p\[definitionof⌊⌋p\]=⌊(⌊f·10p+1+½⌋/10p+1)·10p⌋/10p\[definitionof\[\]p+1\]=⌊⌊f·10p+1+½⌋/10⌋/10p\[simplifying\]=⌊(f·10p+1+½)/10⌋/10p\[lawoffloors\]=⌊f·10p+1/20⌋/10p\[simplifying\]=⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥·10p⌋/10p\[notedabove\]=⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p\[definitionof⌊⌋p\]

(As an aside, this result is not a fluke of 16-bit binary fractions and p=4.
For any b-bit binary fraction, there is an accurate, correctly rounded p+1-digit decimal for p+1=⌈log102b⌉,
because 10p+1>2b. That implies 10p·2−(b+1)>1/20.)

The Digit Collection Lemma proves the correctness of saving one digit per iteration
and using that sequence as the final result.
Let’s make that change.
Here is our current version:

```
)op bin2dec
-- out --
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17
    p = 1
    f = 10 * f
    min = 10 * min
    max = 10 * max
    :while p <= 4
        :if (ceil min) <= (floor max)
            :ret p digits floor max

        p = p + 1
        f = 10 * f
        min = 10 * min
        max = 10 * max

    p digits round f

Updating it to collect digits, we have:

```
op bin2dec f =
    min = f - 2**-17
    max = f + 2**-17

    f = 10 * f

        min = 10 * min
        max = 10 * max

This program is very close to _P2_.
All that remains are straightforward optimizations.

## [Change of Basis](\#change_of_basis)

The first optimization is to remove one of the three multiplications
in the loop body,
using the fact that 𝑚𝑖𝑛, f, and 𝑚𝑎𝑥
are linearly dependent.
If it were up to me, I would keep 𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥
and derive f=(𝑚𝑖𝑛+𝑚𝑎𝑥)/2 as needed,
but to match _P2_, we will instead keep
s=𝑚𝑎𝑥 and t=𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛,
deriving 𝑚𝑎𝑥=s, 𝑚𝑖𝑛=s−t, and f=s−t/2 as needed.

Let’s make that change to the program:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    p = 1
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while p <= 4
        d = d, (floor s) mod 10
        :if (ceil s-t) <= (floor s)
            :ret d
        :end
        p = p + 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end
    d, (round s - t/2) mod 10

```

```
check 'change of basis'
-- out --
✅ change of basis

```

[**Discard Integer Parts**](#discard_integer_parts)

The next optimization is to reduce the size of s (formerly 𝑚𝑎𝑥).
The only use of the integer part of s is to save
the ones digit on each iteration,
so we can discard the integer part
with `s = s mod 1` each time we save the ones digit.
That lets us optimize away the two uses of `mod 10`:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    p = 1
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while p <= 4
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        :if (ceil s-t) <= (floor s)
            :ret d
        :end
        p = p + 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end
    d, round s - t/2

```

```
check 'discard integer parts'
-- out --
✅ discard integer parts

```

After the new `s = s mod 1`, ⌊s⌋=0,
so the `if` condition is really ⌈s−t⌉≤0,
which simplifies to s≤t.
Let’s make that change too:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    p = 1
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while p <= 4
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
        p = p + 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end
    d, round s - t/2

```

```
check 'simplify condition'
-- out --
✅ simplify condition

```

[**Refactoring**](#refactoring)

Next, we can inline `round` on the last line:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    p = 1
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while p <= 4
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
        p = p + 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end
    s = (s - t/2) + 1/2
    d, floor s

```

```
check 'inlined round'
-- out --
✅ inlined round

```

Now the two uses of ‘ `d, floor s`’ can be merged
by moving the final return back into the loop,
provided
(1) we make the `while` loop repeat forever,
(2) we apply the final adjustment to s when p=5,
and (3) we ensure that when p=5, the `if` condition is true,
so that the return is reached.
The `if` condition is checking for digit divergence,
and we know that 𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑚𝑎𝑥 will always diverge
by p=5, so the condition s≤t will be true.
We can also confirm that arithmetically:
t=105·2−16>1>s.

Let’s make that change:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    p = 1
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if p == 5
            s = (s - t/2) + 1/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
        p = p + 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end

```

```
check 'return only in loop'
-- out --
✅ return only in loop

```

Next, since t=10p·2−17, we can replace the condition p=5
with t>1, after which p is unused and can be deleted:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 1
            s = (s - t/2) + 1/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
    :end

```

```
check 'optimize away p'
-- out --
✅ optimize away p

```

Next, note that the truth of s≤t is unchanged by
multiplying both s and t by 10
(and the return does not use them)
so we can move the conditional return
to the end of the loop body:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = f + 2**-17
    t = 2**-16
    s = 10 * s
    t = 10 * t
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 1
            s = (s - t/2) + 1/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s
        s = s mod 1
        s = 10 * s
        t = 10 * t
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
    :end

```

```
check 'move conditional return'
-- out --
✅ move conditional return

```

Finally, let’s merge the consecutive assignments to s and t,
both at the top of `bin2dec` and in the loop:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = 10 * f + 2**-17
    t = 10 * 2**-16
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 1
            s = (s - t/2) + 1/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s
        s = 10 * s mod 1
        t = 10 * t
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
    :end

```

```
check 'merge assignments'
-- out --

```

[**Scaling**](#scaling)

All that remains is to eliminate the use of rational arithmetic.
which we can do by scaling s and t by 216:

```
op bin2dec f =
    s = (10 * f * 2**16) + 5
    t = 10
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 2**16
            s = (s - t/2) + 2**15
        :end
        d = d, floor s/2**16
        s = 10 * s mod 2**16
        t = 10 * t
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
    :end

```

```
check 'no more rationals'
-- out --
✅ no more rationals

```

If written in a modern compiled language,
this is a very efficient program.
(In particular, `floor s/2**16` and `s mod 2**16` are simple bit operations:
`s >> 16` and `s & 0xFFFF` in C syntax.)

And we have arrived at Knuth’s _P2_!

```
)op knuthP2
-- out --
op knuthP2 f =
    n = f * 2**16
    s = (10 * n) + 5
    t = 10
    d = ()
    :while 1
        :if t > 65536
            s = s + 32768 - t/2
        :end
        d = d, floor s/65536
        s = 10 * (s mod 65536)
        t = 10 * t
        :if s <= t
            :ret d
        :end
    :end

```

We started with a trivially correct program
and then incrementally modified it,
proving the correctness of each non-trivial step,
to arrive at _P2_.
We have therefore proved the correctness of _P2_ itself.

## [Simpler Programs and Proofs](\#simpler)

We passed a more elegant iterative solution a few steps back.
If we start with the premultiplied version,
apply the change of basis ε=𝑚𝑎𝑥−f=f−𝑚𝑖𝑛,
scale by 216, and change the program to
return an integer instead of a digit vector,
we arrive at:

```
op shortest f =
    p = 1
    f = 10 * f * 2**16
    ε = 5
    :while p < 5
        :if (ceil (f-ε)/2**16) <= floor (f+ε)/2**16
            :ret (floor (f+ε)/2**16) p
        :end
        p = p + 1
        f = f * 10
        ε = ε * 10
    :end
    (round f/2**16) p

```

The program returns the digits as an integer accompanied by a digit count.
Any modern language can print an integer zero-padded to a given number of digits,
so there is no need for our converter to compute those digits itself.

We can test `shortest` by writing `bin2dec` in terms of `shortest` and `digits`:

```
op bin2dec f =
    d p = shortest f
    p digits d

```

```
check 'simpler'
-- out --
✅ simpler

```

The full proof of correctness is left as an exercise to the reader,
but note that the proof is simpler than the one we just gave for _P2_.
Since we are not collecting digits one at a time,
we do not need the [Digit Collection Lemma](#collection).

This version of `shortest` could be made faster
by using _P2_’s s,t basis,
but I think this form using the f,ε basis is clearer,
and the cost is only one extra addition in the loop body.
The cost of that addition is unlikely to be important compared to
the two multiplications and other arithmetic
(two shifts, one subtraction, one comparison, one increment).

One drawback of this simpler program is that it requires
f to hold numbers up to 105·216>232,
so it needs f to be a 64-bit integer,
and the system Knuth was using probably did not support 64-bit integers.
However, we can adapt this simpler program to
work with 32-bit integers
by observing that each multiplication by 10 adds a new
always-zero low bit, so we can multiply by 5 and adjust
the precision b:

```
op shortest f =
    b = 16
    p = 1
    f = 10 * f * 2**b
    ε = 5
    :while p < 5
        :if (ceil (f-ε)/2**b) <= floor (f+ε)/2**b
            :ret (floor (f+ε)/2**b) p
        :end
        p = p + 1
        b = b - 1
        f = f * 5
        ε = ε * 5
    :end
    (round f/2**b) p

```

```
check '32-bit'
-- out --
✅ 32-bit

```

All modern languages provide efficient 64-bit arithmetic,
so we don’t need that optimization today.

## [A More Direct Solution](\#more_direct_solution)

Raffaello Giulietti’s [Schubfach algorithm](https://fmt.dev/papers/Schubfach4.pdf)
avoids the iteration entirely.
Applied to Knuth’s problem,
we can let p=⌈log102b⌉(=5) and
compute the exact set of accurate p-digit decimals
\[⌈𝑚𝑖𝑛⌉p..⌊𝑚𝑎𝑥⌋p\].
That set contains at most 10 consecutive decimals
(or else p would be smaller),
so at most one can end in a zero.
If one of the accurate decimals d ends in zero,
we can use d after removing its trailing zeros.
(The [Truncating Lemma](#truncating) guarantees
that this shortest accurate decimal will be correctly rounded.)
Otherwise,
we should use the correctly rounded \[f\]p.

```
op shortest f =
    b = 16
    p = ceil 10 log 2**b
    f = (10**p) * f * 2**b
    t = (10**p) * 1/2
    min = ceil  (f - t) / 2**b
    max = floor (f + t) / 2**b
    :if ((d = floor max / 10) * 10) >= min
        p = p - 1
        :while ((d mod 10) == 0) and p > 1
            d = d / 10
            p = p - 1
        :end
        :ret d p
    :end
    (round f / 2**b) p

```

```
check 'schubfach'

✅ schubfach

```

This program still contains a loop,
but only to remove trailing zeros.
In many use cases, short outputs will happen less often than
full-length outputs, so most calls will not loop at all.
Also, all modern compilers implement division by a constant
[using multiplication](divmult),
so the loop costs at most p−1 multiplications.
Finally, we can shorten the worst case,
at the expense of the best case,
by using a (log2p)-iteration loop:
divide away ⌊p/2⌋ trailing zeros
(by checking dmod10⌊p/2⌋), then ⌊p/4⌋, and so on.

## [A Textbook Solution](\#textbook)

All of this raises a mystery.
Knuth started writing TeX82, which introduced the 16-bit fixed-point number
representation, in August 1981 (according to “ [The Errors of TeX](https://yurichev.com/mirrors/knuth1989.pdf)”, page 616),
and the change to introduce shortest outputs
was made in February 1984 (according to [tex82.bug, entry 284](https://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/knuth/dist/errata/tex82.bug)).
The mystery is why Knuth,
working in the early 1980s, did not consult a recently published
textbook that contains the answer,
namely
_The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms (Second Edition)_, by D. E. Knuth
(preface dated July 1980).

![Detour sign](detour1.png)

Before getting to the mystery, we need to detour through
the history of that specific answer.
The first edition of Volume 2 (preface dated October 1968), contained exercise 4.4-3:

> 1. \[25\] (D. Taranto.) The text observes that when fractions are being converted,
>    there is in general no obvious way to decide how many digits to give in the answer.
>    Design a simple generalization of Method (2a)
>    \[incremental digit-at-a-time fraction conversion\]
>    which, given two positive radix b fractions u and ε between 0 and 1,
>    converts u to a radix B equivalent U which has just enough
>    places of accuracy to ensure that \|U−u\|<ε.
>    (If u<ε, we may take U=0, with zero “places of accuracy.”)

The answer at the back of the book starts with the notation “\[CACM 2 (July 1959), 27\]”,
indicating Taranto’s article “ [Binary conversion, with fixed decimal precision, of a decimal fraction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/368370.368376)”.
Taranto’s article is about converting a decimal fraction to a shortest binary
representation, a somewhat simpler problem than Knuth’s exercise poses.
Written in Ivy, with variable names chosen to match this post,
and scaling to accumulate bits in an integer during the loop,
Taranto’s algorithm is:

```
op taranto (f ε) =
    fb = 0
    b = 0
    :while (ε < f) and (f < 1-ε)
        f = 2 * f
        fb = (2 * fb) + floor f
        f = f mod 1
        ε = 2 * ε
        b = b + 1
    :end
    :if (fb & 1) == 0
        fb = fb + 1
    :end
    fb / 2**b

```

If we write f0 and ε0 for the initial f and ε
passed to `shortest`,
then the algorithm accumulates a binary output in fb,
and maintains f=(f0−fb)·2b,
the scaled error of the current output compared to the original input.
When f≤ε, fb is close enough;
when f≥1−ε, fb+1 is close enough.
Otherwise, the algorithm loops to add another output bit.

After the loop, the algorithm forces the low bit to 1.
This handles the “when f≥1−ε, fb+1 is close enough” case.
It would have been clearer to write f≥1−ε,
but testing the low bit is equivalent.
If the last bit added was 0,
the final iteration started with ε<f and did f=2f,ε=2ε,
in which case ε<f must still be true
and the loop ended because f≥1−ε.
And if the last bit added was 1,
the final iteration started with f<1−ε and did f=2f−1,ε=2ε,
in which case f<1−ε must still be true
and the loop ended because f≤ε.

(In fact, Taranto’s presentation took advantage of the fact that
the low bit tells you which half of the loop condition is possible;
it only checked the possible half in each iteration.
For simplicity, the Ivy version omits that optimization.
If you read Taranto’s article, note that the computation
of the loop condition is correct in step B at the top of the page
but incorrect in the IAL code at the bottom of the page.)

For the answer to exercise 4.4-3, Knuth needed to
generalize Taranto’s algorithm to non-binary outputs (B>2),
which he did by changing the final condition to f>1−ε.
For decimal output, the implementation would be:

```
op shortest f =
    ε = 2**-17
    d = 0
    p = 0
    :while (ε < f) and (f < 1-ε)
        f = 10 * f
        d = (10 * d) + floor f
        f = f mod 1
        ε = 10 * ε
        p = p + 1
    :end
    :if f > 1-ε
        d = d + 1
    :end
    d (1 max p)

```

Knuth’s presentation generated digits one at a time
into an array.
I’ve accumulated them into an integer d here,
but that’s only a storage detail.
When incrementing the low digit after the loop,
Knuth’s answer also checked for overflow
from the low digit into higher digits.
That check is unnecessary: if the increment
overflows the bottom digit to zero,
that implies the bottom digit can be removed entirely,
in which case the loop would have stopped earlier.

It turns out that this code is not an answer
to our problem:

```
check 'Knuth Volume 2 1e'
-- out --
❌ Knuth Volume 2 1e

```

The problem is that while it does compute a
shortest accurate decimal, it does not guarantee
correct rounding:

```
shortest dec2bin 0.12344
-- out --
12345 5

```

For binary output,
shortest and correctly rounded are one and the same;
not so in other bases.
As an aside, Taranto’s forcing of the low bit to 1
mishandles the corner case f=0.
Knuth’s updated condition fixes that case,
but it doesn’t correctly round other cases.
All that said, Knuth’s exercise did not ask for correct rounding,
so the answer is still correct for the exercise.

Guy L. Steele and Jon L. White, working in the 1970s
on fixed-point and floating-point formatting,
consulted Knuth’s first edition and adapted this answer
to round correctly.
They wrote a paper with their new algorithms,
both for the fixed-point case we are considering
and for the more general case of floating-point numbers.
That paper presents a correctly-rounding extension of Knuth’s
first edition answer as the algorithm ‘(FP)³’.
The change is tiny: replace f≥1−ε with f≥½.

```
op shortest f =
    ε = 2**-17
    d = 0
    p = 0
    :while (ε < f) and (f < 1-ε)
        f = 10 * f
        d = (10 * d) + floor f
        f = f mod 1
        ε = 10 * ε
        p = p + 1
    :end
    :if f >= 1/2
        d = d + 1
    :end
    d (1 max p)

```

```
check 'Steele and White (FP)³'
-- out --
✅ Steele and White (FP)³

```

In the paper,
Steele and White described the (FP)³ algorithm as
“a generalization of the one
presented by Taranto \[Taranto59\]
and mentioned in exercise 4.4.3 of \[Knuth69\].”
They shared the paper with Knuth
while he was working on the second edition of Volume 2.
In response, Knuth changed the exercise to ask for a
“ _rounded_ radix B equivalent” (my emphasis),
updated the answer to use the new fix-up condition,
removed the unnecessary overflow check,
and cited Steele and White’s unpublished paper.
Knuth introduced the revised answer by saying,
“The following procedure due to G. L. Steele Jr. and Jon L. White
generalizes Taranto’s algorithm for B=2 originally published in
_CACM_ **2**, 7 (July 1959), 27.”
The attribution ‘due to \[Steele and White\]’
omits Knuth’s own substantial contributions
to the generalization effort.

Steele and White [published their paper in 1990](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/93548.93559),
and
Knuth cited it in the third edition of Volume 2 (preface dated July 1997).
At first glance, this seems to create a circular reference in which
both works credit the other for the algorithm,
like a self-justifying
[out-of-thin-air value](https://research.swtch.com/plmm#acausality).
The cycle is broken by noticing that Steele and White carefully
cite the _first edition_ of Volume 2.

In 1984, as Knuth was writing TeX82 and needed code to
implement this conversion, the second edition
had just been published a few years earlier.
So why did Knuth invent a new variant of Taranto’s algorithm
instead of using the one he put in Volume 2?
I find it comforting to imagine that
he made the same mistake we’ve all made
at one time or another: perhaps Knuth simply forgot to check _Knuth_.

But probably not.
Knuth’s “Simple Program” paper
names Steele and White and
cites the answer to exercise 4.4-3.
The wording of the citation suggests that Knuth did not consider
it an answer to his question “Is there a better program?”
Why not?
I don’t know,
but we just saw that it does work.
I plan to
[send Knuth a letter](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html) to ask.

## [Conclusion](\#conclusion)

This post shows what I think is a better way to prove the
correctness of Knuth’s _P2_,
as well as a few candidates for better programs.
More generally, I think the post illustrates that
the capabilities of our programming tools affect
the programs we write with them and
how easy it is to prove those programs correct.

If you are programming a 32-bit computer in the 1980s using a Pascal-like language
in which division is expensive,
it makes perfect sense to compute one digit at a time in a loop
as Knuth did in _P2_.
Going back even further, the iterative digit-at-a-time approach
[made sense on Von Neumann’s computer in the 1940s](https://www.ias.edu/sites/default/files/library/pdfs/ecp/planningcodingof0103inst.pdf) (see p. 53).
Today, a language
with arbitrary precision rationals
makes it easy to write simpler programs.

The choice of language also affects the difficulty of the proof.
Using Ivy made it natural to break the proof into pieces.
We started with a simple proof of a nearly trivial program.
Then we proved the correctness of the “truncated max” version.
Finally we proved the correctness of collecting digits one at a time.
It was easier to write three small proofs than one large proof.
Ivy also made it easy to isolate the complexity of premultiplication
by 10p and scaling by 216; we were able to treat those
steps as optimizations instead of fundamental aspects of the program and proofs.
Now that we know the path, we could write a direct proof of _P2_
along these lines.
But I wouldn’t have seen the path without having a capable language
like Ivy to light the way.

It is also worth noting how the capabilities of our programming
tools affect our perception of what is important in our programs.
After writing his 1989 paper, Knuth optimized
‘ _s_ := _s_ \+ 32768 − ( _t_ **div** 2)’
in the production version of TeX to
‘ _s_ := _s_ − 17232’, because at that point
_t_ is always 100000.
On the [IBM 650](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650) at Case Institute of Technology
where Knuth got his start
(and to which he dedicated his _The Art of Computer Programming_ books),
removing a division and an addition might have been important.
In 1989, however, a good compiler would have optimized ‘ _t_ **div** 2’ to a shift,
and the shift and add would hardly matter compared to the
eight multiplications that preceded them, not to mention the I/O
to print the result,
and the code was probably clearer the first way.
But old habits die hard for all of us.
I spent my formative years programming 32-bit systems, and
I have not broken my old habit
of worrying about ‘32-bit safety’,
as evidenced by [the discussion above](#simpler)!

Knuth wrote in his paper that
“we seek a proof that is comprehensible and educational” and then added:

> Even more, we seek a proof that reflects the ideas used to create
> the program, rather than a proof that was concocted ex post facto.
> The program didn’t emerge by itself from a vacuum, nor did I simply
> try all possible short programs until I found one that worked.

This post is almost certainly not the proof Knuth sought.
On the other hand, I hope that it is comprehensible and educational.
Also, Taranto’s short article
doesn’t include any proof at all,
nor even an explanation of how it works.
If I had to prove Taranto’s algorithm correct,
I would probably proceed as in the initial part of this post.
Then, if you accept Taranto’s algorithm as correct,
the main changes on the way to _P2_ are to
nudge f up to 𝑚𝑎𝑥 at the start
and then nudge it back down on the final iteration.
The
[Truncating Lemma](#truncating)
and the [Digit Collection Lemma](#collection)
prove the correctness of those changes.
Maybe that does match what Knuth had in mind in 1984
when he adapted Taranto’s algorithm.
Maybe the difficulty arose from
having to prove Taranto’s algorithm correct simultaneously.
This post’s incremental approach avoids that complication.

In any event, Happy 88th Birthday Don!

P.S. This is my first blog post using my blog’s new support for
embedding Ivy code and for typesetting equations.
For the latter, I write TeX syntax like inline `` `$s ≤ t$` ``
or fenced ```` ```eqn```` blocks.
A new TeX macro parser that I wrote executes the TeX input
and translates the expanded output to MathML Core,
which all the major browsers now support.
It is only fitting that this is the first post to use
the new TeX-derived mathematical typesetting.
