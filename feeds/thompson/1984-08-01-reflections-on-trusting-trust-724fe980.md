# Reflections on Trusting Trust

Ken Thompson's "cc hack" - Presented in the journal,
Communication of the ACM, Vol. 27, No. 8, August 1984, in a paper
entitled "Reflections on Trusting Trust", Ken Thompson, co-author of
UNIX, recounted a story of how he created a version of the C compiler
that, when presented with the source code for the "login" program,
would automatically compile in a backdoor to allow him entry to the
system. This is only half the story, though. In order to hide this
trojan horse, Ken also added to this version of "cc" the ability to
recognize if it was recompiling itself to make sure that the newly
compiled C compiler contained both the "login" backdoor, and the code
to insert both trojans into a newly compiled C compiler. In this way,
the source code for the C compiler would never show that these trojans
existed.

Reflections on Trusting Trust

by Ken Thompson

Introduction

I
thank the ACM for this award. I can't help but feel that I am receiving
this honor for timing and serendipity as much as technical merit. UNIX
swept into popularity with an industry-wide change from central main
frames to autonomous minis. I suspect that Daniel Bobrow (1) would be
here instead of me if he could not afford a PDP-10 and ad had to
"settle" for a PDP-11. Moreover, the current state of UNIX is the
result of the labors of a large number of people.

There is an
old adage, "Dance with the one that brought you," which means that I
should talk about UNIX. I have not worked on mainstream UNIX in many
years, yet I continue to get undeserved credit for the work of others.
Therefore, I am not going to talk about UNIX, but I want to thank
everyone who has contributed.

That brings me to Dennis Ritchie.
Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty. In the ten years that we
have worked together, I can recall only one case of miscoordination of
work. On that occasion, I discovered that we both had written the same
20-line assembly language program. I compared the sources and was
astounded to find that they matched character-for-character. The result
of our work together has been far greater than the work that we each
contributed.

I am a programmer. On my 1040 form, that is what I
put down as my occupation. As a programmer, I write programs. I would
like to present to you the cutest program I ever wrote. I will do this
in three stages and try to bring it together at the end.

Stage I

In
college, before video games, we would amuse ourselves by posing
programming exercises. One of the favorites was to write the shortest
self-reproducing program. Since this is an exercise divorced from
reality, the usual vehicle was FORTRAN. Actually, FORTRAN was the
language of choice for the same reason that three-legged races are
popular.

More precisely stated, the problem is to write a
source program that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output
an exact copy of its source. If you have never done this, I urge you to
try it on your own. The discovery of how to do it is a revelation that
far surpasses any benefit obtained by being told how to do it. The part
about "shortest" was just an incentive to demonstrate skill and
determine a winner.

FIGURE 1

Figure 1 shows a self-reproducing program in the C programming
language. (The purist will note that the program is not precisely a
self-reproducing program, but will produce a self-reproducing program.)
This entry is much too large to win a prize, but it demonstrates the
technique and has two important properties that I need to complete my
story: (I) This program can be easily written by another program. (2)
This pro- gram can contain an arbitrary amount of excess baggage that
will be reproduced along with the main algorithm. In the example, even
the comment is reproduced.

Stage II

The
C compiler is written in C. What I am about to describe is one of many
"chicken and egg" problems that arise when compilers are written in
their own language. In this ease, I will use a specific example from
the C compiler.

C allows a string construct to specify an
initialized character array. The individual characters in the string
can be escaped to represent unprintable characters. For example,

"Hello world\n"

represents a string with the character "\n," representing the new line character.

FIGURE 2

Figure 2 is an idealization of the code in the C compiler that
interprets the character escape sequence. This is an amazing piece of
code. It "knows" in a completely portable way what character code is
compiled for a new line in any character set. The act of knowing then
allows it to recompile itself, thus perpetuating the knowledge.

FIGURE 3

Suppose we wish to alter the C compiler to include the sequence "\v" to
represent the vertical tab character. The extension to Figure 2 is
obvious and is presented in Figure 3. We then recompile the C compiler,
but we get a diagnostic. Obviously, since the binary version of the
compiler does not know about "\v," the source is not legal C. We must
"train" the compiler. After it "knows" what "\v" means, then our new
change will become legal C. We look up on an ASCII chart that a
vertical tab is decimal 11. We alter our source to look like Figure 4.
Now the old compiler accepts the new source. We install the resulting
binary as the new official C compiler and now we can write the portable
version the way we had it in Figure 3.

FIGURE 4

This is a deep concept. It is as close to a "learning" program as I
have seen. You simply tell it once, then you can use this
self-referencing definition.

Stage III

FIGURE 5

Again,
in the C compiler, Figure 5 represents the high-level control of the C
compiler where the routine "compile" is called to compile the next line
of source. Figure 6 shows a simple modification to the compiler that
will deliberately miscompile source whenever a particular pattern is
matched. If this were not deliberate, it would be called a compiler
"bug." Since it is deliberate, it should be called a "Trojan horse."

FIGURE 6

The actual bug I planted in the compiler would match code in the UNIX
"login" command. The replacement code would miscompile the login
command so that it would accept either the intended encrypted password
or a particular known password. Thus if this code were installed in
binary and the binary were used to compile the login command, I could
log into that system as any user.

Such
blatant code would not go undetected for long. Even the most casual
perusal of the source of the C compiler would raise suspicions.

FIGURE 7

The final step is represented in Figure 7. This simply adds a second
Trojan horse to the one that already exists. The second pattern is
aimed at the C compiler. The replacement code is a Stage I
self-reproducing program that inserts both Trojan horses into the
compiler. This requires a learning phase as in the Stage II example.
First we compile the modified source with the normal C compiler to
produce a bugged binary. We install this binary as the official C. We
can now remove the bugs from the source of the compiler and the new
binary will reinsert the bugs whenever it is compiled. Of course, the
login command will remain bugged with no trace in source anywhere.

Moral

The
moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create
yourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)
No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you
from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this
kind of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any
program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even
hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will
be harder and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug will be
almost impossible to detect.

After trying to convince you that
I cannot be trusted, I wish to moralize. I would like to criticize the
press in its handling of the "hackers," the 414 gang, the Dalton gang,
etc. The acts performed by these kids are vandalism at best and
probably trespass and theft at worst. It is only the inadequacy of the
criminal code that saves the hackers from very serious prosecution. The
companies that are vulnerable to this activity (and most large
companies are very vulnerable) are pressing hard to update the criminal
code. Unauthorized access to computer systems is already a serious
crime in a few states and is currently being addressed in many more
state legislatures as well as Congress.

There is an explosive situation brewing. On the one hand, the press,
television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz
kids. On the other hand, the acts performed by these kids will soon be
punishable by years in prison.

I have watched kids testifying
before Congress. It is clear that they are completely unaware of the
seriousness of their acts. There is obviously a cultural gap. The act
of breaking into a computer system has to have the same social stigma
as breaking into a neighbor's house. It should not matter that the
neighbor's door is unlocked. The press must learn that misguided use of
a computer is no more amazing than drunk driving of an automobile.

Acknowledgment

I
first read of the possibility of such a Trojan horse in an Air Force
critique (4) of the security of an early implementation of Multics. I
can- not find a more specific reference to this document. I would
appreciate it if anyone who can supply this reference would let me know.
