# LLVM Debian/Ubuntu nightly packages

In order to facilitate testing and to improve the deployment of the LLVM toolchain, we are happy to [publish LLVM Debian/Ubuntu nightly packages](http://llvm.org/apt/). Read on for information about how it works and what we're building.

These packages provide LLVM, Clang, compiler-rt, polly and LLDB.

They are built for Debian:

- Wheezy (future stable)
- Unstable

and Ubuntu:

- Precise
- Quantal
- Raring

For now, amd64 and i386 are supported.

For example, installing the nightly build of clang 3.3 is as simple as:

```

```

_echo "deb http://llvm.org/apt/wheezy/ llvm-toolchain-wheezy main"> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list_

_apt-get update_

_apt-get install clang-3.3_

Packages are automatically built twice a day for every architecture and operating system in clean chroots. They are built by a [Jenkins instance](http://llvm-jenkins.debian.net/) hosted by [IRILL](http://www.irill.org/) and push the LLVM infrastructure.

## Repositories

### **Debian**

wheezy (currently testing)

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/wheezy/ llvm-toolchain-wheezy main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/wheezy/ llvm-toolchain-wheezy main

```

sid (unstable)

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/unstable/ llvm-toolchain main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/unstable/ llvm-toolchain main

```

### **Ubuntu**

Precise (12.04)

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/precise/ llvm-toolchain-precise main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/precise/ llvm-toolchain-precise main
```

```

```

Quantal (12.10)

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/quantal/ llvm-toolchain-quantal main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/quantal/ llvm-toolchain-quantal main
```

```

```

Raring (13.04)

```
deb http://llvm.org/apt/raring/ llvm-toolchain-raring main
deb-src http://llvm.org/apt/raring/ llvm-toolchain-raring main
```

## Install

The following commands will install all packages provided by the llvm-toolchain:

```
apt-get install clang-3.3 clang-3.3-doc libclang-common-dev libclang-dev libclang1 libclang1-dbg libllvm-3.3-ocaml-dev libllvm3.3 libllvm3.3-dbg lldb-3.3 llvm-3.3 llvm-3.3-dev llvm-3.3-doc llvm-3.3-examples llvm-3.3-runtime

```

## Technical workflow

Twice a day, each jenkins job will checkout the debian/ directory necessary to build the packages. The repository is available on the Debian hosting infrastructure: [http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-llvm/llvm-toolchain/branches/](http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-llvm/llvm-toolchain/branches/). In the _llvm-toolchain-\*-source_, the following tasks will be performed:

- upstream sources will be checkout
- tarballs will be created. They are named:
  - llvm-toolchain\_X.Y~svn123456.orig-lldb.tar.bz2
  - llvm-toolchain\_X.Y~svn123456.orig-compiler-rt.tar.bz2
  - llvm-toolchain\_X.Y~svn123456.orig.tar.bz2
  - llvm-toolchain\_X.Y~svn123456.orig-clang.tar.bz2
  - llvm-toolchain\_X.Y~svn123456.orig-polly.tar.bz2
- Debian .dsc package description is created
- Start the jenkins job _llvm-toolchain-X-binary_

Then, the job _llvm-toolchain-X-binary_ will:

- Create a chroot using cowbuilder or update it is already existing
- Install libisl >=0.11 if necessary (for polly)
- Build all the packages
- Launch lintian, the Debian static analyzer
- Publish the result on the LLVM repository

Note that a [few patches](http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-llvm/llvm-toolchain/branches/snapshot/debian/patches/) are applied over the LLVM tarballs (and should be merged upstream soon).

## Future

This versatile infrastructure allows some more interesting features like:

- Automatic launch of scan-build on the whole code
- Full bootstrap of LLVM/Clang
- Code coverage on the latest release
