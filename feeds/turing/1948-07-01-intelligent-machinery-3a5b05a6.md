# Intelligent Machinery

Intelligent Machinery

A. M. Turing
[1912—1954]

Abstract

The possible ways in which machinery might be made to show intelligent
behaviour are discussed. The analogy with the human brain is used as a
guiding principle. It is pointed out that the potentialities of the human
intelligence can only be realized if suitable education is provided. The
investigation mainly centres round an analogous teaching process applied
to machines. The idea of an unorganized machine is defined, and it is suggested
that the infant human cortex is of this nature. Simple examples of such
machines are given, and their education by means of rewards and punish-
ments is discussed. In one case the education process is carried through until
the organization is similar to that of an ACE.

I propose to investigate the question as to whether it is possible for mach-
inery to show intelligent behaviour. It is usually assumed without argument
that it is not possible. Common catch phrases such as ‘acting like a machine’,
‘purely mechanical behaviour’ reveal this common attitude. It is not diffi-
cult to see why such an attitude should have arisen. Some of the reasons
are:
(a) An unwillingness to admit the possibility that mankind can have any
rivals in intellectual power. This occurs as much amongst intellectual
people as amongst others: they have more to lose. Those who admit the
possibility all agree that its realization would be very disagreeable. The
same situation arises in connection with the possibility of ou being
superseded by some other animal species, This is almost as disagreeable
and its theoretical possibility is indisputable.
(b) A religious belief that any attempt to construct such machines is a
sort of Promethean irreverence.
(c) The very limited character of the machinery which has been used until
recent times (e.g. up to 1940). This encouraged the belief that machinery
was necessarily limited to extremely straightforward, possibly even to repeti-
tive, jobs. This attitude is very well expressed by Dorothy Sayers (The
Mind of the Maker p. 46) ‘... which imagines that God, having created
his Universe, has now screwed the cap on His pen, put His feet on the

mantelpiece and left the work to get on with itself.’ This, however, rather
comes into St Augustine’s category of figures of speech or enigmatic
sayings framed from things which do not exist at all. We simply do not
know of any creation which goes on creating itself in variety when the
creator has withdrawn from it. The idea is that God simply created a
vast machine and has left it working until it runs down from lack of fuel.
This is another of those obscure analogies, since we have no experience of
machines that produce variety of their own accord; the nature of a machine
is to ‘do the same thing over and over again so long as it keeps going’.
(d) Recently the theorem of Gédel and related results (Gédel 1931,
Church 1936, Turing 1937) have shown that if one tries to use machines
for such purposes as determining the truth or falsity of mathematical
theorems and one is not willing to tolerate an occasional wrong result,
then any given machine will in some cases be unable to give an answer at
all. On the other hand the human intelligence seems to be able to find
methods of ever-increasing power for dealing with such problems ‘trans-
cending’ the methods available to machines.

(e) In so far as a machine can show intelligence this is to be regarded as
nothing but a reflection of the intelligence of its creator.

REFUTATION OF SOME OBJECTIONS

In this section I propose to outline reasons why we do not need to be
influenced by the above-described objections. The objections (a) and (b),
being purely emotional, do not really need to be refuted. If one feels it
necessary to refute them there is little to be said that could hope to prevail,
though the actual production of the machines would probably have some
effect. In so far then as we are influenced by such arguments we are bound
to be left feeling rather uneasy about the whole project, at any rate for the
present. These arguments cannot be wholly ignored, because the idea of
‘intelligence’ is itself emotional rather than mathematical.

The objection (c) in its crudest form is refuted at once by the actual
existence of machinery (ENIAC etc.) which can go on through immense
numbers (e.g. 106000 about for ACE) of operations without repetition,
assuming no breakdown. The more subtle forms of this objection will be
considered at length on pages 18-22.

The argument from Gédel’s and other theorems (objection d) rests
essentially on the condition that the machine must not make mistakes. But
this is not a requirement for intelligence. It is related that the infant Gauss
was asked at school to do the addition 15+18+21+ ... +54 (or something
of the kind) and that he immediately wrote down 483, presumably having
calculated it as (15+54)(54—12)/2.3. One can imagine circumstances
where a foolish master told the child that he ought instead to have added 18
to 15 obtaining 33, then added 21, etc. From some points of view this would
be a ‘mistake’, in spite of the obvious intelligence involved. One can also

4
[108]

TURING

imagine a situation where the children were given a number of additions to
do, of which the first 5 were all arithmetic progressions, but the 6th was say
234+344+45+4+ ... +100+1124+122+...+199. Gauss might have given
the answer to this as if it were an arithmetic progression, not having noticed
that the 9th term was 112 instead of I11. This would be a definite mistake,
which the less intelligent children would not have been likely to make.

The view (d) that intelligence in machinery is merely a reflection of that of
its creator is rather similar to the view that the credit for the discoveries of a
pupil should be given to his teacher. In such a case the teacher would be
pleased with the success of his methods of education, but would not claim
the results themselves unless he had actually communicated them to his
pupil. He would certainly have envisaged in very broad outline the sort of
thing his pupil might be expected to do, but would not expect to foresee any
sort of detail. It is already possible to produce machines where this sort of
situation arises in a small degree. One can produce ‘paper machines’ for
playing chess. Playing against such a machine gives a definite feeling that
one is pitting one’s wits against something alive.

These views will all be developed more completely below.

VARIETIES OF MACHINERY

It will not be possible to discuss possible means of producing intelligent
machinery without introducing a number of technical terms to describe
different kinds of existent machinery,

‘Discrete’ and ‘continuous’ machinery. We may call a machine ‘discrete’
when it is natural to describe its possible states as a discrete set, the motion
of the machine occurring by jumping from one state to another. The states
of ‘continuous’ machinery on the other hand form a continuous manifold,
and the behaviour of the machine is described by a curve on this manifold.
All machinery can be regarded as continuous, but when it is possible to
regard it as discrete it is usually best to do so. The states of discrete machinery
will be described as ‘configurations’.

‘Controlling’ and ‘active’ machinery. Machinery may be described as ‘con-
trolling’ if it only deals with information, In practice this condition is much
the same as saying that the magnitude of the machine’s effects may be as
small as we please, so long as we do not introduce confusion through
Brownian movement, etc, ‘Active’ machinery is intended to produce some
definite physical effect.

Examples A Bulldozer Continuous Active
A Telephone Continuous Controlling
A Brunsviga Discrete Controlling
A Brain (probably) Continuous Controlling, but is very

similar to much discrete machinery

PROLOGUE

The ENIAC, ACE, etc. Discrete Controlling
A Differential Analyser Continuous Controlling.

We shall mainly be concerned with discrete controlling machinery. As we
have mentioned, brains very nearly fall into this class, and there seems every
reason to believe that they could have been made to fall genuinely into it
without any change in their essential properties. However, the property of
being ‘discrete’ is only an advantage for the theoretical investigator, and
serves no evolutionary purpose, so we could not expect Nature to assist us
by producing truly ‘discrete’ brains.

Given any discrete machine the first thing we wish to find out about it is
the number of states (configurations) it can have. This number may be
infinite (but enumerable) in which case we say that the machine has infinite
memory (or storage) capacity. If the machine has a finite number N of
possible states then we say that it has a memory capacity of (or equivalent
to) logzN binary digits. According to this definition we have the following
table of capacities, very roughly

Brunsviga 90
ENIAC without cards and with fixed programme 600
ACE as proposed 60,000

Manchester machine (as actually working 8 August 1947) 1,100

The memory capacity of a machine more than anything else determines
the complexity of its possible behaviour.

The behaviour of a discrete machine is completely described when we are
given the state (configuration) of the machine as a function of the im-
mediately preceding state and the relevant external data.

Logical computing machines (LC Ms)

In Turing (1937) a certain type of discrete machine was described. It had
an infinite memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape marked
out into squares on each of which a symbol could be printed. At any moment
there is one symbol in the machine; it is called the scanned symbol. The
machine can alter the scanned symbol and its behaviour is in part described
by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect the
behaviour of the machine. However the tape can be moved back and forth
through the machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the
machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an innings.
These machines will here be called ‘Logical Computing Machines’. They
are chiefly of interest when we wish to consider what a machine could in
principle be designed to do, when we are willing to allow it both unlimited
time and unlimited storage capacity.
Universal logical computing machines. It is possible to describe LCMs in a
very standard way, and to put the description into a form which can be

6

[110]

TURING

‘understood’ (i.e., applied by) a special machine. In particular it is possible
to design a ‘universal machine’ which is an Lc such that if the standard
description of some other LCM is imposed on the otherwise blank tape from
outside, and the (universal) machine then set going it will carry out the
operations of the particular machine whose description it was given. For
details the reader must refer to Turing (1937).

The importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not need to have
an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A single one will
suffice. The engineering problem of producing various machines for various
jobs is replaced by the office work of ‘programming’ the universal machine
to do these jobs.

It is found in practice that LCMs can do anything that could be described
as ‘rule of thumb’ or ‘purely mechanical’. This is sufficiently well established
that it is now agreed amongst logicians that ‘calculable by means of an
Lem’ is the correct accurate rendering of such phrases. There are several
mathematically equivalent but superficially very different renderings.

Practical computing machines (PC Ms)

Although the operations which can be performed by LCMs include every rule-
of-thumb process, the number of steps involved tends to be enormous. This
is mainly due to the arrangement of the memory along the tape. Two facts
which need to be used together may be stored very far apart on the tape.
There is also rather little encouragement, when dealing with these machines,
to condense the stored expressions at all. For instance the number of symbols
required in order to express a number in Arabic form (e.g., 149056) cannot
be given any definite bound, any more than if the numbers are expressed in
the ‘simplified Roman’ form (IIIII...I, with 149056 occurrences of I).
As the simplified Roman system obeys very much simpler laws one uses it
instead of the Arabic system.

In practice however one can assign finite bounds to the numbers that one
will deal with. For instance we can assign a bound to the number of steps
that we will admit in a calculation performed with a real machine in the
following sort of way. Suppose that the storage system depends on charging
condensers of capacity C=1 yf, and that we use two states of charging,
E=100 volts and ~E=— 100 volts. When we wish to use the information
carried by the condenser we have to observe its voltage. Owing to thermal
agitation the voltage observed will always be slightly wrong, and the proba-
bility of an error between V and V—dYV volts is

2kT
—— €

—4V2C/kT
rei VdV

where k is Boltzmann’s constant. Taking the values suggested we find that.

the probability of reading the sign of the voltage wrong is about 1071'2*10°°,
If then a job took more than 1010'’ steps we should be virtually certain of

7

111]

[5]

[6]

PROLOGUE

getting the wrong answer, and we may therefore restrict ourselves to jobs
with fewer steps. Even a bound of this order might have useful simplifying
effects. More practical bounds are obtained by assuming that a light wave
must travel at least 1 cm between steps (this would only be false with a very
small machine), and that we could not wait more than 100 years for an
answer. This would give a limit of 1020 steps. The storage capacity will
probably have a rather similar bound, so that we could use sequences of
20 decimal digits for describing the position in which a given piece of data
was to be found, and this would be a really valuable possibility.

Machines of the type generally known as ‘Automatic Digital Computing
Machines’ often make great use of this possibility. They also usually put a
great deal of their stored information in a form very different from the tape
form. By means of a system rather reminiscent of a telephone exchange it is
made possible to obtain a piece of information almost immediately by
‘dialling’ the position of this information in the store. The delay may be only
a few microseconds with some systems. Such machines will be described as
‘Practical Computing Machines’.

Universal practical computing machines. Nearly all of the PcMs now under
construction have the essential properties of the ‘Universal Logical Comput-
ing Machines’ mentioned earlier. In practice, given any job which could
have been done on an LCM one can also do it on one of these digital computers.
I do not mean that we can do any required job of the type mentioned on it
by suitable programming. The programming is pure paper work. It naturally
occurs to one to ask whether, e.g., the ACE would be truly universal if its
memory capacity were infinitely extended. I have investigated this question,
and the answer appears to be as follows, though I have not proved any
formal mathematical theorem about it. As has been explained, the ACE at
present uses finite sequences of digits to describe positions in its memory:
they are actually sequences of 9 binary digits (September 1947). The ACE
also works largely for other purposes with sequences of 32 binary digits. If
the memory were extended, e.g., to 1000 times its present capacity, it would
be natural to arrange the memory in blocks of nearly the maximum capacity
which can be handled with the 9 digits, and from time to time to switch
from block to block. A relatively small part would never be switched. This
would contain some of the more fundamental instruction tables and those
concerned with switching. This part might be called the ‘central part’. One
would then need to have a number which described which block was in
action at any moment. However this number might be as large as one pleased.
Eventually the point would be reached where it could not be stored in a
word (32 digits), or even in the central part. One would then have to set
aside a block for storing the number, or even a sequence of blocks, say
blocks 1, 2,.... We should then have to store n, and in theory it would be
of indefinite size. This sort of process can be extended in all sorts of ways,
but we shall always be left with a positive integer which is of indefinite size

and which needs to be stored somewhere, and there seems to be no way out
of the difficulty but to introduce a ‘tape’. But once this has been done, and
since we are only trying to prove a theoretical result, one might as well,
whilst proving the theorem, ignore all the other forms of storage. One will
in fact have a ULCM with some complications. This in effect means that one
will not be able to prove any result of the required kind which gives any
intellectual satisfaction.

Paper machines

It is possible to produce the effect of a computing machine by writing down
a set of rules of procedure and asking a man to carry them out. Such a
combination of a man with written instructions will be called a ‘Paper
Machine’. A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to
strict discipline, is in effect a universal machine. The expression ‘paper
machine’ will often be used below.

Partially random and apparently partially random machines

It is possible to modify the above described types of discrete machines by
allowing several alternative operations to be applied at some points, the
alternatives to be chosen by a random process. Such a machine will be
described as ‘partially random’. If we wish to say definitely that a machine is
not of this kind we will describe it as ‘determined’, Sometimes a machine
may be strictly speaking determined but appear superficially as if it were
partially random. This would occur if for instance the digits of the number
m were used to determine the choices of a partially random machine, where
previously a dice thrower or electronic equivalent had been used. These
machines are known as apparently partially random.

UNORGANIZED MACHINES

So far we have been considering machines which are designed for a definite
purpose (though the universal machines are in a sense an exception). We
might instead consider what happens when we make up a machine in a
comparatively unsystematic way from some kind of standard components.
We could consider some particular machine of this nature and find out what
sort of things it is likely to do. Machines which are largely raridom in their
construction in this way will be called ‘Unorganized Machines’. This does
not pretend to be an accurate term. It is conceivable that the same
machine might be regarded by one man as organized and by another as
unorganized.

A typical example of an unorganized machine would be as follows. The
machine is made up from a rather large number WN of similar units. Each unit
has two input terminals, and has an output terminal which can be connected
to the input terminals of (0 or more) other units. We may imagine that for
each integer r, 1<r<N two numbers i(r) and j(r) are chosen at random

9

1113]

[7]

PROLOGUE

from 1... N and that we connect the inputs of unit r to the outputs of units

(r) and j(r). All of the units are connected to a central synchronizing unit
from which synchronizing pulses are emitted at more or less equal intervals of
time. The times when these pulses arrive will be called ‘moments’. Each unit
is capable of having two states at each moment. These states may be called
0 and 1. The state is determined by the rule that the states of the units from
which the input leads come are to be taken at the previous moment, multiplied
together and the result subtracted from 1. An unorganized machine of this
character is shown in the diagram below.

r i(r) ji) ) 2)
J 3 2
2 3 5
3 4 5
4 3 4

A sequence of six possible consecutive conditions for the whole machine is:

| 1100 1 0
2 1 1101 0
3 OoO1i1i1t1ii1
4 01010 1
5 1010 1 0

The behaviour of a machine with so few units is naturally very trivial.
However, machines of this character can behave in a very complicated manner
when the number of units is large. We may call these A-type unorganized
machines. Thus the machine in the diagram is an A-type unorganized machine
of 5 units. The motion of an A-type machine with N units is of course even-
tually periodic, as in any determined machine with finite memory capacity.
The period cannot exceed 2” moments, nor can the length of time before the
periodic motion begins. In the example above the period is 2 moments and
there are 3 moments before the periodic motion begins. 2% is 32.

The A-type unorganized machines are of interest as being about the simplest
model of a nervous system with a random arrangement of neurons. It would
therefore be of very great interest to find out something about their behaviour.
A second type of unorganized machine will now be described, not because it is

10
1114]

TURING

of any great intrinsic importance, but because it will be useful later for
illustrative purposes. Let us denote the circuit

by

WY
[J
Y

as an abbreviation. Then for each A-type unorganized machine we can
construct another machine by replacing each connection —-—~>——— in it by

+I >. The resulting machines will be called B-type unorganized
machines, It may be said that the B-type machines are all A-type. To this I
would reply that the above definitions if correctly (but drily!) set out would
take the form of describing the probability of an a- (or B-) type machine
belonging to a given set; it is not merely a definition of which are the A-type
machines and which are the B-type machines, If one chooses an A-type
machine, with a given number of units, at random, it will be extremely
unlikely that one will get a B-type machine.

It is easily seen that the connection ——+{_}——> can have three
conditions. It may (i) pass all signals through with interchange of 0 and 1,
or (ii) it may convert all signals into 1, or again (iii) it may act as in (i) and
(ii) in alternate moments. (Alternative (iii) has two sub-cases.) Which of
these cases applies depends on the initial conditions. There is a delay of two

moments in going through t—>{_}——-> .

INTERFERENCE WITH MACHINERY. MODIFIABLE AND

SELF-MODIFYING MACHINERY
The types of machine that we have considered so far are mainly ones that are
allowed to continue in their own way for indefinite periods without inter-
ference from outside. The universal machines were an exception to this, in
that from time to time one might change the description of the machine which
is being imitated. We shall now consider machines in which such interference
is the rule rather than the exception.

We may distinguish two kinds of interference. There is the extreme form
in which parts of the machine are removed and replaced by others. This may
be described as ‘screwdriver interference’, At the other end of the scale is
‘paper interference’, which consists in the mere communication of information
to the machine, which alters its behaviour, In view of the properties of the
universal machine we do not need to consider the difference between these

11

[115]

PROLOGUE

~ two kinds of machine as being so very radical after all. Paper interference
when applied to the universal machine can be as useful as screwdriver
interference.

We shall mainly be interested in paper interference. Since screwdriver
interference can produce a completely new machine without difficulty there
is- rather little to be said about it. In future ‘interference’ will normally mean
‘paper interference’.

When it is possible to alter the behaviour of a machine very radically we
may speak of the machine as being ‘modifiable’. This is a relative term. One
machine may be spoken of as being more modifiable than another.

One may also sometimes speak of a machine modifying itself, or of a
machine changing its own instructions. This is really a nonsensical form of
phraseology, but is convenient. Of course, according to our conventions the
‘machine’ is completely described by the relation between its possible con-
figurations at consecutive moments. It is an abstraction which, by the form
of its definition, cannot change in time. If we consider the machine as starting
in a particular configuration, however, we may be tempted to ignore those
configurations which cannot be reached without interference from it. If we
do this we should get a ‘successor relation’ for the configurations with different
properties from the original one and so a different ‘machine’.

If we now consider interference, we should say that each time interference
occurs the machine is probably changed. It is in this sense that interference
‘modifies’ a machine. The sense in which a machine can modify itself is even
more remote. We may, if we wish, divide the operations of the machine into
two classes, normal and self-modifying operations. So long as only normal
operations are performed we regard the machine as unaltered. Clearly the
idea of ‘self-modification’ will not be of much interest except where the
division of operations into the two classes is made very carefully. The sort of
case I have in mind is a computing machine like the ACE where large parts
of the storage are normally occupied in holding instruction tables. (Instruc-
tion tables are the equivalent in UPCMs of descriptions of machines in
ULCMs). Whenever the content of this storage was altered by the internal
operations of the machine, one would naturally speak of the machine
‘modifying itself”.

MAN AS A MACHINE

A great positive reason for believing in the possibility of making thinking
machinery is the fact that it is possible to make machinery to imitate any
small part of a man. That the microphone does this for the ear, and the
television camera for the eye are commonplaces. One can also produce
remote-controlled robots whose limbs balance the body with the aid of
servo-mechanisms, Here we are chiefly interested in the nervous system. We
could produce fairly accurate electrical models to copy the behaviour of
nerves, but there seems very little point in doing so. It would be rather like

12
[116]

TURING

putting a lot of work into cars which walked on legs instead of continuing to
use wheels. The electrical circuits which are used in electronic computing
machinery seem to have the essential properties of nerves. They are able to
transmit information from place to place, and also to store it. Certainly the
nerve has many advantages. It is extremely compact, does not wear out
(probably for hundreds of years if kept in a suitable medium!) and has a
very low energy consumption. Against these advantages the electronic
circuits have only one counter-attraction, that of speed. This advantage is, how-
ever, on such a scale that it may possibly outweigh the advantages of the nerve.

One way of setting about our task of building a ‘thinking machine’ would
be to take a man as a whole and to try to replace all the parts of him by
machinery. He would include television cameras, microphones, loudspeakers,
wheels and ‘handling servo-mechanisms’ as well as some sort of ‘electronic
brain’. This would be a tremendous undertaking of course. The object, if
produced by present techniques, would be of immense size, even if the ‘brain’
part were stationary and controlled the body from a distance. In order that
the machine should have a chance of finding things out for itself it should be
allowed to roam the countryside, and the danger to the ordinary citizen
would be serious. Moreover even when the facilities mentioned above were
provided, the creature would still have no contact with food, sex, sport and
many other things of interest to the human being, Thus although this method
is probably the ‘sure’ way of producing a thinking machine it seems to be
altogether too slow and impracticable. .

Instead we propose to try and see what can be done with a ‘brain’ which is
more or less without a body providing, at most, organs of sight, speech, and
hearing. We are then faced with the problem of finding suitable branches of
thought for the machine to exercise its powers in, The following fields appear
to me to have advantages:

(i) Various games, e.g., chess, noughts and crosses, bridge, poker
(ii) The learning of languages
(iii) Translation of languages

(iv) Cryptography
(v) Mathematics.

Of these (i), (iv), and to a lesser extent (iii) and (v) are good in that they
require little contact with the outside world. For instance in order that the
machine should be able to play chess its only organs need be ‘eyes’ capable
of distinguishing the various positions on a specially made board, and
means for announcing its own moves. Mathematics should preferably be
restricted to branches where diagrams are not much used. Of the above
possible fields the learning of languages would be the most impressive, since —
it is the most human of these activities, This field seems however to depend
rather too much on sense organs and locomotion to be feasible.

13

117]

[8]

PROLOGUE

The field of cryptography will perhaps be the most rewarding. There is a
remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those
of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corres-
ponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence
available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which

have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject

matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery,
physics not so easily.

EDUCATION OF MACHINERY

Although we have abandoned the plan to make a ‘whole man’, we should be
wise to sometimes compare the circumstances of our machine with those of
a man. It would be quite unfair to expect a machine straight from the factory
to compete on equal terms with a university graduate. The graduate has had
contact with human beings for twenty years or more. This contact has been
modifying his behaviour pattern throughout that period. His teachers have
been intentionally trying to modify it. At the end of the period a large number
of standard routines will have been superimposed on the original pattern of
his brain. These routines will be known to the community as a whole. He is
then in a position to try out new combinations of these routines, to make
slight variations on them, and to apply them in new ways.

We may say then that in so far as a man is a machine he is one that is
subject to very much interference. In fact interference will be the rule rather
than the exception. He is in frequent communication with other men, and is
continually receiving visual and other stimuli which themselves constitute
a form of interference. It will only be when the man is ‘concentrating’ with a
view to eliminating these stimuli or ‘distractions’ that he approximates a
machine without interference.

We are chiefly interested in machines with comparatively little inter-
ference, for reasons given in the last section, but it is important to remember
that although a man when concentrating may behave like a machine without
interference, his behaviour when concentrating is largely determined by the
way he has been conditioned by previous interference.

If we are trying to produce an intelligent machine, and are following the
human model as closely as we can, we should begin with a machine with very
little capacity to carry out elaborate operations or to react in a disciplined
manner to orders (taking the form of interference). Then by applying
appropriate interference, mimicking education, we should hope to modify
the machine until it could be relied on to produce definite reactions to certain
commands. This would be the beginning of the process. I will not attempt to
follow it further now.

ORGANIZING UNORGANIZED MACHINERY

Many unorganized machines have configurations such that if once that
configuration is reached, and if the interference thereafter is appropriately

14
[118]

TURING

restricted, the machine behaves as one organized for some definite purpose.
For instance, the B-type machine shown below was chosen at random.

__ OUT

If the connections numbered 1, 3, 6, 4, are in condition (ii) initially and
connections 2, 5, 7 are in condition (i), then the machine may be considered
to be one for the purpose of passing on signals with a delay of 4 moments.
This is a particular case of a very general property of B-type machines (and
many other types), viz., that with suitable initial conditions they will do
any required job, given sufficient time and provided the number of units is
sufficient. In particular with a B-type unorganized machine with sufficient
units one can find initial conditions which will make it into a universal
machine with a given storage capacity. (A formal proof to this effect might
be of some interest, or even a demonstration of it starting with a particular
unorganized B-type machine, but I am not giving it as it lies rather too far
outside the main argument. )

With these B-type machines the possibility of interference which could
set in appropriate initial conditions has not been arranged for. It is however
not difficult to think of appropriate methods by which this could be done,
For instance instead of the connection

Here A, B are interfering inputs, normally giving the signal ‘1’. By supplying
appropriate other signals at A, B we can get the connection into condition
(i) or (ii), as desired. However this requires two special interfering inputs
for each connection.

We shall be interested mainly in cases where there are only quite few
independent inputs altogether, so that all the interference which sets up the
‘initial conditions’ of the machine has to be provided through one or two
inputs. The process of setting up these initial conditions so that the machine
will carry out some particular useful task may be called ‘organizing the
machine’. ‘Organizing’ is thus a form of ‘modification’.

THE CORTEX AS AN UNORGANIZED MACHINE

Many parts of a man’s brain are definite nerve circuits required for quite
definite purposes. Examples of these are the ‘centres’ which control respira-
tion, sneezing, following moving objects with the eyes, etc.: all the reflexes
proper (not ‘conditioned’) are due to the activities of these definite structures
in the brain. Likewise the apparatus for the more elementary analysis of
shapes and sounds probably comes into this category. But the more intel-
lectual activities of the brain are too varied to be managed on this basis.
The difference between the languages spoken on the two sides of the Channel
is not due to difference in development of the French-speaking and English-
speaking parts of the brain. It is due to the linguistic parts having been
subjected to different training. We believe then that there are large parts of
the brain, chiefly in the cortex, whose function is largely indeterminate. In
the infant these parts do not have much effect: the effect they have is unco-
ordinated. In the adult they have great and purposive effect: the form of this
effect depends on the training in childhood. A large remnant of the random
behaviour of infancy remains in the adult.

All of this suggests that the cortex of the infant is an unorganized machine,
which can be organized by suitable interfering training. The organizing might
result in the modification of the machine into a universal machine or some-
thing like it. This would mean that the adult will obey orders given in appro-
priate language, even if they were very complicated; he would have no
common sense, and would obey the most ridiculous orders unflinchingly.
When all his orders had been fulfilled he would sink into a comatose state or
perhaps obey some standing order, such as eating. Creatures not unlike
this can really be found, but most people behave quite differently under
many circumstance. However the resemblance to a universal machine is still
very great, and suggests to us that the step from the unorganized infant to a
universal machine is one which should be understood. When this has been
mastered we shall be in a far better position to consider how the organizing
process might have been modified to produce a more normal type of
mind.

This picture of the cortex as an unorganized machine is very satisfactory

16

from the point of view of evolution and genetics. It clearly would not require
any very complex system of genes to produce something like the A- or B-type
unorganized machine. In fact this should be much easier than the production
of such things as the respiratory centre. This might suggest that intelligent
races could be produced comparatively easily. I think this is wrong because
the possession of a human cortex (say) would be virtually useless if no attempt
was made to organize it. Thus if a wolf by a mutation acquired a human
cortex there is little reason to believe that he would have any selective
advantage. If however the mutation occurred in a milieu where speech had
developed (parrot-like wolves), and if the mutation by chance had well
permeated a small community, then some selective advantage might be felt.
It would then be possible to pass information on from generation to genera-
tion. However this is all rather speculative.

EXPERIMENTS IN ORGANIZING: PLEASURE-PAIN SYSTEMS

It is interesting to experiment with unorganized machines admitting definite
types of interference and try to organize them, e.g., to modify them into
universal machines,

The organization of a machine into a universal machine would be most
impressive if the arrangements of interference involve very few inputs, The
training of the human child depends largely on a system of rewards and
punishments, and this suggests that it ought to be possible to carry through
the organizing with only two interfering inputs, one for ‘pleasure’ or
‘reward’ (R) and the other for ‘pain’ or punishment’ (P). One can devise a
large number of such ‘pleasure—pain’ systems. I will use this term to mean an
unorganized machine of the following general character: The configurations
of the machine are described by two expressions, which we may call the
character-expression and the situation-expression. The character and situa-
tion at any moment, together with the input signals, determine the character
and situation at the next moment. The character may be subject to some
random variation. Pleasure interference has a tendency to fix the character, i.e.,
towards preventing it changing, whereas pain stimuli tend to disrupt the
character, causing features which had become fixed to change, or to become
again subject to random variation.

This definition is probably too vague and general to be very helpful.
The idea is that when the ‘character’ changes we like to think .of it. as a
change in the machine, but the ‘situation’ is merely the configuration of
the machine described by the character. It is intended that pain stimuli
occur when the machine’s behaviour is wrong, pleasure stimuli when it
is particularly right. With appropriate stimuli on these lines, judiciously
operated by the ‘teacher’, one may hope that the ‘character’ will converge
towards the one desired, i.e., that wrong behaviour will tend to become rare. |

I have investigated a particular type of pleasure—pain system, which I will
now describe.

THE P-TYPE UNORGANIZED MACHINE

The P-type machine may be regarded as an LCM without a tape, and whose
description is largely incomplete. When a configuration is reached, for which
the action is undetermined, a random choice for the missing data is made and
the appropriate entry is made in the description, tentatively, and is applied.

_ When a pain stimulus occurs all tentative entries are cancelled, and when a

pleasure stimulus occurs they are all made permanent.

Specifically. The situation is a number s=1, 2,..., N and corresponds to
the configuration of the incomplete machine. The character is a table of N
entries showing the behaviour of the machine in each situation. Each entry
has to say something both about the next situation and about what action
the machine has to take. The action part may be either

(i) To do some externally visible act Ay or Az... Ax

(ii) To set one of the memory units M; ... Mg either into the ‘1’ condition

or into the ‘0’ condition.

The next situation is always the remainder either of 2s or of 2s+1 on
division by NW. These may be called alternatives 0 and 1. Which alternative
applies may be determined by either

(a) one of the memory units

(b) a sense stimulus

(c) the pleasure—pain arrangements.

In each situation it is determined which of these applies when the machine is
made, i.e., interference cannot alter which of the three cases applies. Also in
cases (a) and (b) interference can have no effect. In case (c) the entry in the
character table may be either U (‘uncertain’), or TO (tentative 0), Tl, DO
(definite 0) or D1. When the entry in the character for the current situation
is U then the alternative is chosen at random, and the entry in the character
is changed to TO or T1 according as 0 or 1 was chosen. If the character entry
was TO or DO then the alternative is 0 and if it is T1 or D1 then the alternative
is |. The changes in character include the above mentioned change from U to
TO or Tl, and a change of every T to D when a pleasure stimulus occurs,
changes of TO and T1 to U when a pain stimulus occurs.

We may imagine the memory units essentially as ‘trigger circuits’ or
switches. The sense stimuli are means by which the teacher communicates
‘unemotionally’ to the machine, i.e., otherwise than by pleasure and pain
stimuli. There are a finite number S of sense stimulus lines, and each always
carries either the signal 0 or 1.

A small p-type machine is described in the table below

1 P A
2P B Mil=1
3 PB
4 S! A MI=0
5 MI C

TURING

In this machine there is only one memory unit M1 and one sense line S1. Its
behaviour can be described by giving the successive situations together with
the actions of the teacher: the latter consist of the values of S1 and the rewards
and punishments. At any moment the ‘character’ consists of the above table
with each ‘P’ replaced by either U, TO, DO or D1. In working out the behaviour
of the machine it is convenient first of all to make up a sequence of random
digits for use when the U cases occur. Underneath these we may write the
sequence of situations, and have other rows for the corresponding entries
from the character, and for the actions of the teacher. The character and the
values stored in the memory units may be kept on another sheet. The T
entries may be made in pencil and the D entries in ink. A bit of the behaviour
of the machine is given below:

It will be noticed that the machine very soon got into a repetitive cycle. This
became externally visible through the repetitive BABAB.... By means of
a pain stimulus this cycle was broken.

It is probably possible to organize these p-type machines into universal
machines, but it is not easy because of the form of memory available. It
would be necessary to organize the randomly distributed ‘memory units’ to
provide a systematic form of memory, and this would not be easy. If, however,
we supply the P-type machine with a systematic external memory this
organizing becomes quite feasible. Such a memory could be provided in the
form of a tape, and the externally visible operations could include movement
to right and left along the tape, and altering the symbol on the tape to 0 or
to 1. The sense lines could include one from the symbol on the tape. Alterna-
tively, if the memory were to be finite, e.g., not more than 232 binary digits,
we could use a dialling system. (Dialling systems can also be used with an
infinite memory, but this is not of much practical interest.) I have succeeded
in organizing such a (paper) machine into a universal machine.

The details of the machine involved were as follows. There was a circular
memory consisting of 64 squares of which at any moment one was in the
machine (‘scanned’) and motion to right or left were among the ‘visible
actions’. Changing the symbol on the square was another ‘visible action’,
and the symbol was connected to one of the sense lines S1. The even-numbered |
squares also had another function, they controlled the dialling of information
to or from the main memory. This main memory consisted of 232 binary

19

[123]

PROLOGUE

digits. At any moment one of these digits was connected to the sense line 82.
The digit of the main memory concerned was that indicated by the 32 even
positioned digits of the circular memory. Another two of the ‘visible actions’
were printing 0 or 1 in this square of the main memory. There were also
three ordinary memory units and three sense units $3, $4, S5. Also six other
_ externally visible actions A,B,C,D,E,F.

This p-type machine with external memory has, it must be admitted,
considerably more ‘organization’ than say the A-type unorganized machine.
Nevertheless the fact that it can be organized into a universal machine still
remains interesting.

The actual technique by which the ‘organizing’ of the p-type machine was
carried through is perhaps a little disappointing. It is not sufficiently analogous
to the kind of process by which a child would really be taught. The process
actually adopted was first to let the machine run for a long time with con-
tinuous application of pain, and with various changes of the sense data S3,
S4, S5. Observation of the sequence of externally visible actions for some
thousands of moments made it possible to set up a scheme for identifying
the situations, i.e., by which one could at any moment find out what the
situation was, except that the situations as a whole had been renamed.
A similar investigation, with less use of punishment, enables one to find the
situations which are affected by the sense lines; the data about the situations
involving the memory units can also be found but with more difficulty. At
this stage the character has been reconstructed. There are no occurrences of
TO, Tl, DO, D1. The next stage is to think up some way of replacing the Os
of the character by DO, D1 in such a way as to give the desired modification.
This will normally be possible with the suggested number of situations
(1000), memory units, etc. The final stage is the conversion of the character
into the chosen one. This may be done simply by allowing the machine to
wander at random through a sequence of situations, and applying pain
stimuli when the wrong choice is made, pleasure stimuli when the right one is
made. It is best also to apply pain stimuli when irrelevant choices are made.
This is to prevent getting isolated in a ring of irrelevant situations. The
machine is now ‘ready for use’.

The form of universal machine actually produced in this process was as
follows. Each instruction consisted of 128 digits, which we may regard as
forming four sets of 32, each of which describes one place in the main memory.
These places may be called P,Q,R,S. The meaning of the instruction is that
if p is the digit at P and qg that at Q then | —pq is to be transferred to position
R and that the next instruction will be found in the 128 digits beginning at S.
This gives a UPCM, though with rather less facilities than are available say
on the ACE.

I feel that more should be done on these lines. I would like to investigate
other types of unorganized machines, and also to try out organizing methods
that would be more nearly analogous to our ‘methods of education’. I made

20

TURING

a Start on the latter but found the work altogether too laborious at present.
When some electronic machines are in actual operation J hope that they will
make this more feasible. It should be easy to make a model of any particular
machine that one wishes to work on within such a UPCM instead of having
to work with a paper machine as at present. If also one decided on quite
definite ‘teaching policies’ these could also be programmed into the machine.
One would then allow the whole system to run for an appreciable period,
and then break in as a kind of ‘inspector of schools’ and see what progress
had been made. One might also be able to make some progress with un-
organized machines more like the A- and B-types. The work involved with
these is altogether too great for pure paper-machine work.

One particular kind of phenomenon I had been hoping to find in connection
with the p-type machines, This was the incorporation of old routines into
new. One might have ‘taught’ (i.e., modified or organized) a machine to
add (say). Later one might teach it to multiply by small numbers by repeated
addition and so arrange matters that the same set of situations which formed
the addition routine, as originally taught, was also used in the additions
involved in the multiplication. Although I was able to obtain a fairly detailed
picture of how this might happen I was not able to do experiments on a
sufficient scale for such phenomena to be seen as part of a large context.

I also hoped to find something rather similar to the ‘irregular verbs’ which
add variety to language. We seem to be quite content that things should not
obey too mathematically regular rules. By long experience we can pick up
and apply the most complicated rules without being able to enunciate them
at all. I rather suspect that a P-type machine without the systematic memory
would behave in a rather similar manner because of the randomly distributed
memory units. Clearly this could only be verified by very painstaking work;
by the very nature of the problem ‘mass production’ methods like built-in
teaching procedures could not help.

DISCIPLINE AND INITIATIVE

If the untrained infant’s mind is to become an intelligent one, it must acquire
both discipline and initiative. So far we have been considering only discipline.
To convert a brain or machine into a universal machine is the extremest form
of discipline. Without something of this kind one cannot set up proper
communication. But discipline is certainly not enough in itself to produce
intelligence. That which is required in addition we call initiative. This state-
ment will have to serve as a definition. Our task is to discover the nature of
this residue as it occurs in man, and to try and copy it in machines.

Two possible methods of setting about this present themselves. On the one
hand we have fully disciplined machines immediately available, or in a

matter of months or years, in the form of various UPCMs. We might try to |

graft some initiative onto these. This would probably take the form of
programming the machine to do every kind of job that could be done, as a

21

PROLOGUE

matter of principle, whether it were economical to do it by machine or not,
Bit by bit one would be able to allow the machine to make more and more
‘choices’ or ‘decisions’. One would eventually find it possible to program
it so as to make its behaviour be the logical result of a comparatively small
number of general principles. When these became sufficiently general,
interference would no longer be necessary, and the machine would have
‘grown up’. This may be called the ‘direct method’.

The other method is to start with an unorganized machine and to try to
bring both discipline and initiative into it at once, i.e., instead of trying to
organize the machine to become a universal machine, to organize it for
initiative as well. Both methods should, I think, be attempted.

Intellectual, genetical and cultural searches

A very typical sort of problem requiring some sort of initiative consists of
those of the form ‘Find a number n such that ...’. This form covers a very
great variety of problems. For instance problems of the form ‘See if you can
find a way of calculating the function which will enable us to obtain the values
for arguments...to accuracy... within a time...using the UPCM...’
are reducible to this form, for the problem is clearly equivalent to that of
finding a program to put on the machine in question, and it is easy to put the
programs into correspondence with the positive integers in such a way that
given either the number or the program the other can easily be found. We
should not go far wrong for the time being if we assumed that all problems
were reducible to this form. It will be time to think again when something
turns up which is obviously not of this form.

The crudest way of dealing with such a problem is to take the integers in
order and to test each one to see whether it has the required property, and to
go on until one is found which has it. Such a method will only be successful
in the simplest cases, For instance in the case of problems of the kind
mentioned above, where one is really searching for a program, the number
required will normally be somewhere between 21000 and 21,000,000, For practi-
cal work therefore some more expeditious method is necessary. In a number
of cases the following method would be successful. Starting with a UPCM we
first put a program into it which corresponds to building in a logical system
(like Russell’s Principia Mathematica). This would not determine the
behaviour of the machine completely: at various stages more than one choice
as to the next step would be possible. We might arrange, however, to take all
possible arrangement of choices in order, and go on until the machine proved
a theorem, which, by its form, could be verified to give a solution of the
problem. This may be seen to be a conversion of the original problem into
another of the same form. Instead of searching through values of the original
variable n one searches through values of something else. In practice when
solving problems of the above kind one will probably apply some very
complex ‘transformation’ of the original problem, involving searching through

22
[126]

TURING

various variables, some more analogous to the original one, some more like
a ‘search through all proofs’. Further research into intelligence of machinery
will probably be very greatly concerned with ‘searches’ of this kind. We may
perhaps call such searches ‘intellectual searches’. They might very briefly
be defined as ‘searches carried out by brains for combinations with particular
properties’.

It may be of interest to mention two other kinds of search in this connec-
tion. There is the genetical or evolutionary search by which a combination of
genes is looked for, the criterion’ being survival value. The remarkable
success of this search confirms to some extent the idea that intellectual
activity consists mainly of various kinds of search.

The remaining form of search is what I should like to call the ‘cultural
search’. As I have mentioned, the isolated man does not develop any intel-
lectual power. It is necessary for him to be immersed in an environment of
other men, whose techniques he absorbs during the first twenty years of his
life. He may then perhaps do a little research of his own and make a very few
discoveries which are passed on to other men. From this point of view the
search for new techniques must be regarded as carried out by the human
community as a whole, rather than by individuals.

INTELLIGENCE AS AN EMOTIONAL CONCEPT

The extent to which we regard something as behaving in an intelligent
manner is determined as much by our own state of mind and training as by
the properties of the object under consideration. If we are able to explain
and predict its behaviour or if there seems to be little underlying plan, we
have little temptation to imagine intelligence. With the same object therefore
it is possible that one man would consider it as intelligent and another would
not; the second man would have found out the rules of its behaviour.

It is possible to do a little experiment on these lines, even at the present
stage of knowledge. It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will
play a not very bad game of chess. Now get three men as subjects for the
experiment A,B,C. A and C are to be rather poor chess players, B is the operator
who works the paper machine. (In order that he should be able to work it
fairly fast it is advisable that he be both mathematician and chess player.)
Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves, and a
game is played between C and either A or the paper machine. c may find it
quite difficult to tell which he is playing. (This is a rather idealized form of an
experiment I have actually done.)
