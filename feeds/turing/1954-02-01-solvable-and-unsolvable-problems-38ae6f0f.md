Introduction
Jack Copeland

Unsolvable Problems
In Chapter 1 Turing proves the existence of mathematical problems that cannot
be solved by the universal Turing machine. There he also advances the thesis,
now called the Church–Turing thesis, that any systematic method for solving
mathematical problems can be carried out by the universal Turing machine.
Combining these two propositions yields the result that there are mathematical
problems which cannot be solved by any systematic method—cannot, in other
words, be solved by any algorithm.

Substitution Puzzles
In ‘Solvable and Unsolvable Problems’ Turing sets out to explain this result to a
lay audience. The article Wrst appeared in Science News, a popular science journal
of the time. Starting from concrete examples of problems that do admit of
algorithmic solution, Turing works his way towards an example of a problem
that is not solvable by any systematic method. Loosely put, this is the problem of
sorting puzzles into those that will ‘come out’ and those that will not. Turing
gives an elegant argument showing that a sharpened form of this problem is not
solvable by means of a systematic method (pp. 591–2).
   The sharpened form of the problem involves what Turing calls ‘the substitu-
tion type of puzzle’. An typical example of a substitution puzzle is this. Starting
with the word BOB, is it possible to produce BOOOB by replacing selected
occurrences of the pair OB by BOOB and selected occurences of the triple BOB
by O? The answer is yes:
                  BOB ! BBOOB ! BBOBOOB ! BOOOB:

                                                    Solvable and Unsolvable Problems | 577

   Turing suggests that any puzzle can be re-expressed as a substitution puzzle.
Some row of letters can always be used to represent the ‘starting position’
envisaged in a particular puzzle, e.g. in the case of a chess problem, the pieces
on the board and their positions. Desired outcomes, for example board positions
that count as wins, can be described by further rows of letters, and the rules of
the puzzle, whatever they are, are to be represented in terms of permissible
substitutions of groups of letters for other groups of letters.
   As Turing points out, it is not only ‘toy’ puzzles that can be re-expressed as
substitution puzzles, but also mathematical problems, for instance the problem
of Wnding a proof of a given mathematical theorem within an axiom system
(which Turing describes as ‘a very good example of a puzzle’). The axioms—
which are simply strings of mathematical symbols—form the starting position.
The theorem—another string of symbols—is the winning position. The rules of
the puzzle are substitutions that enable strings of mathematical symbols to be
transformed into other strings, much as in the case of the transition from BOB to
BBOOB in the earlier example.
   Turing calls the substitution formulation of any puzzle its ‘normal form’ and
states the following normal form principle (p. 588):
Given any puzzle, we can Wnd a corresponding substitution puzzle which is equivalent to
it in the sense that given a solution of the one we can easily use it to Wnd a solution of the
other.

Normal Forms and the Church–Turing Thesis
The normal form principle for puzzles closely parallels the Church–Turing thesis,
which says that given any systematic method, we can Wnd a corresponding
Turing machine that is equivalent to it.
   Neither the normal form principle for puzzles nor the Church–Turing thesis is
susceptible to deWnite proof (see ‘Computable Numbers: A Guide’). While few
doubt that the Church–Turing thesis is in fact true, the very nature of the thesis
has always been a matter for debate. Church, for example, described the thesis as
a deWnition.1 Post, on the other hand, described it as a ‘working hypothesis’ that
is in need of ‘continual veriWcation’, and he criticized Church for masking this
hypothesis as a deWnition.2 Turing’s remarks in ‘Solvable and Unsolvable
Problems’ about the status of the normal form principle for puzzles are of
outstanding interest for the light that they may cast on his view concerning

the status of the Church–Turing thesis. In this connection, see also the
material from Turing’s draft typescript quoted in n. 9 on p. 590.
  Turing says of the normal form principle (pp. 588–9):
The statement is . . . one which one does not attempt to prove. Propaganda is more
appropriate to it than proof, for its status is something between a theorem and a
deWnition. In so far as we know a priori what is a puzzle and what is not, the statement
is a theorem. In so far as we do not know what puzzles are, the statement is a deWnition
which tells us something about what they are. One can of course deWne a puzzle by some
phrase beginning, for instance, ‘A set of deWnite rules . . .’, but this just throws us back on
the deWnition of ‘deWnite rules’. Equally one can reduce it to the deWnition of ‘computable
function’ or ‘systematic procedure’. A deWnition of any one of these would deWne all the
rest.

  Turing would perhaps have said much the same concerning not only the
Church–Turing thesis but also the thesis introduced in Chapter 13:
  A digital computer will replace any rival design of calculating machine.
In so far as we do not know what calculating machines are, the statement is a
deWnition which tells us something about what they are.

Proof of Unsolvability
Having introduced the normal form principle for puzzles, Turing turns to his
central project of establishing that ‘there cannot be any systematic procedure for
determining whether a puzzle be solvable or not’ (p. 590). In particular, there
cannot be a systematic procedure for determining whether substitution puzzles
are or are not solvable. Turing argues by reductio ad absurdum. He shows that the
supposition that there is a systematic procedure for determining whether substi-
tution puzzles are or are not solvable leads to an outright contradiction, and on
that basis concludes that there can be no such procedure. The argument turns on
the impossibility of applying a certain procedure to itself.
  Any systematic procedure is in eVect a puzzle, since in following the procedure
one applies rules to some ‘starting position’ until one or another result is
achieved. So if there were a systematic procedure for determining whether each
puzzle is or is not solvable, then by the normal form principle, there is a
substitution puzzle—call it K—that is equivalent to this procedure. When
applied to any substitution puzzle, K—if it exists—must ‘come out’ either with
the result s o l va b l e or with the result n ot s o l v a bl e. Since K is applicable
to any substitution puzzle, K can be applied to itself in order to determine
whether it itself is or is not solvable. Turing shows (p. 592) that this supposed
ability of K to pronounce on its own solvability leads to outright contradiction,
and so concludes that K cannot exist.

The Meaning of ‘Unsolvable’
Turing points out that the result he has established, namely that there is no
systematic method for deciding whether or not substitution puzzles come out, is
often expressed by saying that there is no decision procedure for puzzles of this
type, and that the decision problem for this type of puzzle is unsolvable. He
continues (p. 592): ‘so one comes to speak (as in the title of this article) about
‘‘unsolvable problems’’ meaning in eVect puzzles for which there is no decision
procedure. This is the technical meaning which the words are now given by
mathematical logicians.’
   As Turing says, this terminology is potentially confusing. It is natural to use
the words ‘unsolvable problem’ to mean a problem for which no solution can
possibly be found. It would be a confusion to think that Turing has shown that
the problem of deciding whether or not substitution puzzles come out is an
unsolvable problem in this natural sense. Indeed, with suYcient time, inventive-
ness, and patience, mathematicians may always be able to establish whether or
not any given substitution puzzle comes out. If that is so, then the problem of
deciding whether or not substitution puzzles come out is solvable, in the natural
sense of the word.
   What Turing has shown is that there is no systematic method for deciding
whether or not substitution puzzles come out, i.e. there is no general procedure,
applicable by rote, that one can employ in order to decide whether or not each
substitution puzzle comes out. The ‘decision problem’ for substitution puzzles is
the problem of Wnding such a rote procedure (a ‘decision procedure’); in showing
that there is no such procedure, Turing has shown that the decision problem for
substitution puzzles is unsolvable in the natural sense.
   Turing therefore recommends that, in order to ‘minimize confusion’, one
should ‘always speak of ‘‘unsolvable decision problems’’, rather than just ‘‘un-
solvable problems’’ ’ (p. 592).

Significance of Turing’s Result
Turing ends the chapter with a comment on the signiWcance of what he has
shown. His result concerning the decision problem for substitution puzzles ‘may
be regarded as going some way towards a demonstration, within mathematics
itself, of the inadequacy of ‘‘reason’’ unsupported by common sense’. For he has,
he says, set ‘certain bounds to what we can hope to achieve purely by reasoning’.
   The phrase ‘purely by reasoning’ here presumably means ‘purely by algorith-
mic methods’. Some mathematical problems require for their solution not only
‘reason’, in this sense, but also what Turing refers to in Chapter 3 as ‘intuition’
(see also Chapter 4). There he says (pp. 192–3):

580 | Jack Copeland

The activity of the intuition consists in making spontaneous judgements which are not the
result of conscious trains of reasoning. . . . Often it is possible to Wnd some other way of
verifying the correctness of an intuitive judgement. We may, for instance, judge that all
positive integers are uniquely factorizable into primes; a detailed mathematical argument
leads to the same result. This argument will also involve intuitive judgements, but they
will be less open to criticism than the original judgement about factorization. . . . The
necessity for using the intuition is . . . greatly reduced by setting down formal rules for
carrying out inferences which are always intuitively valid. . . . In pre-Gödel times it was
thought by some that it would probably be possible to carry this programme to such a
point that all the intuitive judgements of mathematics could be replaced by a Wnite
number of these rules. The necessity for intuition would then be entirely eliminated.

  The argument of ‘Solvable and Unsolvable Problems’ illustrates why it is that
the need for intuition cannot always be eliminated in favour of formal rules.

Gödel’s Theorem
Turing notes that the unsolvability of the decision problem for substitution
puzzles aVords an elegant proof of the following rather general statement
(p. 593):
   no systematic method of proving mathematical theorems is suYciently com-
   plete to settle every mathematical question, yes or no.
The proof Turing gives is as follows. Each statement of the form ‘such-and-such
substitution puzzle comes out’ can be expressed in the form of a mathematical
statement. So if there were a systematic method of settling every question that
can be posed in mathematical form, this method would serve as a decision
procedure for substitution puzzles. Given that there is no such decision proced-
ure, it follows that no systematic method is able to settle every mathematical
question.
   Turing remarks that the above statement follows ‘by a famous theorem of
Gödel’ and describes himself as providing ‘an independent proof ’ of the state-
ment (p. 593). Turing might also have pointed out that his own ‘On Computable
Numbers’ yields a proof of this statement.
   Gödel’s famous incompleteness theorem of 1931 is, however, importantly less
general than the above statement, since it concerns only one particular systematic
method of proving mathematical theorems, the system set out by Whitehead and
Russell in Principia Mathematica3 (as explained in ‘Computable Numbers: A
Guide’). Gödel did later generalize his result of 1931 to all formal systems
(containing a certain amount of arithmetic), but emphasized the importance
that Turing’s work played in this generalization. Gödel said in 1964:

  3 A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell, Principia Mathematica, vols. i–iii (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1910–13).

[D]ue to A. M. Turing’s work, a precise and unquestionably adequate deWnition of the
general concept of formal system can now be given . . . Turing’s work gives an analysis of
the concept of ‘mechanical procedure’ (alias ‘algorithm’ or ‘computation procedure’ or
‘Wnite combinatorial procedure’). . . . A formal system can simply be deWned to be any
mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas.4

   In his references to Gödel’s work, Turing hides his own light under a bushel.

Solvable and Unsolvable Problems
If one is given a puzzle to solve one will usually, if it proves to be diYcult, ask the
owner whether it can be done. Such a question should have a quite deWnite
answer, yes or no, at any rate provided the rules describing what you are allowed
to do are perfectly clear. Of course the owner of the puzzle may not know the
answer. One might equally ask, ‘How can one tell whether a puzzle is solvable?’,
but this cannot be answered so straightforwardly. The fact of the matter is that
there is no systematic method of testing puzzles to see whether they are solvable
or not. If by this one meant merely that nobody had ever yet found a test which
could be applied to any puzzle, there would be nothing at all remarkable in the
statement. It would have been a great achievement to have invented such a test,
so we can hardly be surprised that it has never been done. But it is not merely
that the test has never been found. It has been proved that no such test ever can
be found.
   Let us get away from generalities a little and consider a particular puzzle. One
which has been on sale during the last few years and has probably been seen by
most of the readers of this article illustrates a number of the points involved
quite well. The puzzle consists of a large square within which are some smaller
movable squares numbered 1 to 15, and one empty space, into which any of the
neighbouring squares can be slid leaving a new empty space behind it. One may
be asked to transform a given arrangement of the squares into another by a
succession of such movements of a square into an empty space. For this puzzle
there is a fairly simple and quite practicable rule by which one can tell whether
the transformation required is possible or not. One Wrst imagines the transform-
ation carried out according to a diVerent set of rules. As well as sliding the
squares into the empty space one is allowed to make moves each consisting of
two interchanges, each of one pair of squares. One would, for instance, be
allowed as one move to interchange the squares numbered 4 and 7, and also
the squares numbered 3 and 5. One is permitted to use the same number in both
pairs. Thus one may replace 1 by 2, 2 by 3, and 3 by 1 as a move because this is
the same as interchanging Wrst (1, 2) and then (1, 3). The original puzzle is
solvable by sliding if it is solvable according to the new rules. It is not solvable by
sliding if the required position can be reached by the new rules, together with a
‘cheat’ consisting of one single interchange of a pair of squares.1 Suppose, for
instance, that one is asked to get back to the standard position—

    1 It would take us too far from our main purpose to give the proof of this rule: the reader should have
little diYculty in proving it by making use of the fact that an odd number of interchanges can never bring a
set of objects back to the position it started from.

One may, according to the modiWed rules, Wrst get the empty square into the
correct position by moving the squares 15 and 12, and then get the squares 1, 2,
3, . . . successively into their correct positions by the interchanges (1, 10), (2, 10),
(3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 9), (6, 10), (7, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (11, 15). The squares 8, 12,
13, 14, 15 are found to be already in their correct positions when their turns are
reached. Since the number of interchanges required is even, this transformation
is possible by sliding.2 If one were required after this to interchange say square 14
and 15 it could not be done.
   This explanation of the theory of the puzzle can be regarded as entirely satisfac-
tory. It gives one a simple rule for determining for any two positions whether one
can get from one to the other or not. That the rule is so satisfactory depends very
largely on the fact that it does not take very long to apply. No mathematical
method can be useful for any problem if it involves much calculation. It is
nevertheless sometimes interesting to consider whether something is possible at
all or not, without worrying whether, in case it is possible, the amount of labour or
calculation is economically prohibitive. These investigations that are not con-
cerned with the amount of work involved are in some ways easier to carry out,
and they certainly have a greater aesthetic appeal. The results are not altogether
without value, for if one has proved that there is no method of doing something it
follows a fortiori that there is no practicable method. On the other hand, if one
method has been proved to exist by which the decision can be made, it gives some
encouragement to anyone who wishes to Wnd a workable method.
   From this point of view, in which one is only interested in the question, ‘Is
there a systematic way of deciding whether puzzles of this kind are solvable?’, the
rules which have been described for the sliding-squares puzzle are much more
special and detailed than is really necessary. It would be quite enough to say:
‘Certainly one can Wnd out whether one position can be reached from another by

   2 It can in fact be done by sliding successively the squares numbered 7, 14, 13, 11, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 8, 5,
4, 6, 3, 10, 1, 2, 6, 3, 10, 6, 2, 1, 6, 7, 15, 8, 5, 10, 8, 5, 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 15, 5, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 15, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14,
13, 15, 10, 13, 15, 11, 9, 10, 11, 15, 13, 12, 14, 13, 15, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 13, 15, 14, 13, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,
13, 14, 15, 12, 11, 10, 9, 13, 14, 15.

a systematic procedure. There are only a Wnite number of positions in which the
numbered squares can be arranged (viz. 20922789888000) and only a Wnite
number (2, 3, or 4) of moves in each position. By making a list of all the
positions and working through all the moves, one can divide the positions into
classes, such that sliding the squares allows one to get to any position which is in
the same class as the one started from. By looking up which classes the two
positions belong to one can tell whether one can get from one to the other
or not.’ This is all, of course, perfectly true, but one would hardly Wnd such
remarks helpful if they were made in reply to a request for an explanation of
how the puzzle should be done. In fact they are so obvious that under such
circumstances one might Wnd them somehow rather insulting. But the fact of the
matter is, that if one is interested in the question as put, ‘Can one tell by a
systematic method in which cases the puzzle is solvable?’, this answer is entirely
appropriate, because one wants to know if there is a systematic method, rather
than to know of a good one.
   The same kind of argument will apply for any puzzle where one is allowed to
move certain ‘pieces’ around in a speciWed manner, provided that the total
number of essentially diVerent positions which the pieces can take up is Wnite.
A slight variation on the argument is necessary in general to allow for the fact
that in many puzzles some moves are allowed which one is not permitted to
reverse. But one can still make a list of the positions, and list against these Wrst
the positions which can be reached from them in one move. One then adds the
positions which are reached by two moves and so on until an increase in the
number of moves does not give rise to any further entries. For instance, we can
say at once that there is a method of deciding whether a patience can be got out
with a given order of the cards in the pack: it is to be understood that there is
only a Wnite number of places in which a card is ever to be placed on the table. It
may be argued that one is permitted to put the cards down in a manner which is
not perfectly regular, but one can still say that there is only a Wnite number of
‘essentially diVerent’ positions. A more interesting example is provided by those
puzzles made (apparently at least) of two or more pieces of very thick twisted
wire which one is required to separate. It is understood that one is not allowed to
bend the wires at all, and when one makes the right movement there is always
plenty of room to get the pieces apart without them ever touching, if one wishes
to do so. One may describe the positions of the pieces by saying where some
three deWnite points of each piece are. Because of the spare space it is not
necessary to give these positions quite exactly. It would be enough to give
them to, say, a tenth of a millimetre. One does not need to take any notice of
movements of the puzzle as a whole: in fact one could suppose one of the pieces
quite Wxed. The second piece can be supposed to be not very far away, for, if it is,
the puzzle is already solved. These considerations enable us to reduce the number
of ‘essentially diVerent’ positions to a Wnite number, probably a few hundred

                                                      Solvable and Unsolvable Problems | 585

millions, and the usual argument will then apply. There are some further compli-
cations, which we will not consider in detail, if we do not know how much
clearance to allow for. It is necessary to repeat the process again and again
allowing successively smaller and smaller clearances. Eventually one will Wnd
that either it can be solved, allowing a small clearance margin, or else it cannot be
solved even allowing a small margin of ‘cheating’ (i.e. of ‘forcing’, or having the
pieces slightly overlapping in space). It will, of course, be understood that this
process of trying out the possible positions is not to be done with the physical
puzzle itself, but on paper, with mathematical descriptions of the positions, and
mathematical criteria for deciding whether in a given position the pieces overlap,
etc.
   These puzzles where one is asked to separate rigid bodies are in a way like the
‘puzzle’ of trying to undo a tangle, or more generally of trying to turn one knot
into another without cutting the string. The diVerence is that one is allowed to
bend the string, but not the wire forming the rigid bodies. In either case, if
one wants to treat the problem seriously and systematically one has to replace
the physical puzzle by a mathematical equivalent. The knot puzzle lends itself
quite conveniently to this. A knot is just a closed curve in three dimensions
nowhere crossing itself; but, for the purpose we are interested in, any knot can
be given accurately enough as a series of segments in the directions of the three
coordinate axes. Thus, for instance, the trefoil knot (Figure 1a) may be regarded
as consisting of a number of segments joining the points given, in the usual (x, y,
z) system of coordinates, as (1, 1, 1), (4, 1, 1,), (4, 2, 1), (4, 2, !1), (2, 2, !1), (2,
2, 2), (2, 0, 2), (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 0), (3, 3, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 3, 1), and returning again
with a twelfth segment to the starting point (1, 1, 1).3 This representation of the
knot is shown in perspective in Figure 1b. There is no special virtue in the
representation which has been chosen. If it is desired to follow the original curve
more closely a greater number of segments must be used. Now let a and d
represent unit steps in the positive and negative X-directions respectively, b and e
in the Y-directions, and c and f in the Z-directions: then this knot may be
described as aaabffddccceeaffbbbddcee.4 One can then, if one wishes, deal
entirely with such sequences of letters. In order that such a sequence
should represent a knot it is necessary and suYcient that the numbers of
a’s and d’s should be equal, and likewise the number of b’s equal to the
number of e’s and the number of c’s equal to the number of f ’s, and it must
not be possible to obtain another sequence of letters with these properties
by omitting a number of consecutive letters at the beginning

or the end or both. One can turn a knot into an equivalent one by operations of
the following kinds—
       (i) One may move a letter from one end of the row to the other.
      (ii) One may interchange two consecutive letters provided this still gives a
           knot.
     (iii) One may introduce a letter a in one place in the row, and d somewhere else,
           or b and e, or c and f, or take such pairs out, provided it still gives a knot.
     (iv) One may replace a everywhere by aa and d by dd or replace each b and e
           by bb and ee or each c and f by cc and V. One may also reverse any such
           operation.
—and these are all the moves that are necessary.

   It is also possible to give a similar symbolic equivalent for the problem of
separating rigid bodies, but it is less straightforward than in the case of knots.
   These knots provide an example of a puzzle where one cannot tell in advance
how many arrangements of pieces may be involved (in this case the pieces
are the letters a, b, c, d, e, f ), so that the usual method of determining whether
the puzzle is solvable cannot be applied. Because of rules (iii) and (iv) the lengths
of the sequences describing the knots may become indeWnitely great. No system-
atic method is yet known by which one can tell whether two knots are the same.
   Another type of puzzle which we shall Wnd very important is the ‘substitution
puzzle’. In such a puzzle one is supposed to be supplied with a Wnite number of
diVerent kinds of counters, perhaps just black (B) and white (W ). Each kind is in
unlimited supply. Initially a number of counters are arranged in a row and one is
asked to transform it into another pattern by substitutions. A Wnite list of the
substitutions allowed is given. Thus, for instance, one might be allowed the
substitutions5
                                        (i) WBW ! B
                                       (ii) BW ! WBBW
and be asked to transform WBW into WBBBW, which could be done as follows

              WBW               WWBBW                    WWBWBBW                   WBBBW
                         (ii)                   (ii)                        (i)

Here the substitutions used are indicated by the numbers below the arrows, and
their eVects by underlinings. On the other hand if one were asked to transform
WBB into BW it could not be done, for there are no admissible steps which
reduce the number of B’s.
   It will be seen that with this puzzle, and with the majority of substitution
puzzles, one cannot set any bound to the number of positions that the original
position might give rise to.
   It will have been realized by now that a puzzle can be something rather more
important than just a toy. For instance the task of proving a given mathematical
theorem within an axiomatic system is a very good example of a puzzle.
   It would be helpful if one had some kind of ‘normal form’ or ‘standard form’
for describing puzzles. There is, in fact, quite a reasonably simple one which I

  5 Editor’s note. Turing’s draft has: ‘Thus for instance one might be allowed the substitutions

shall attempt to describe. It will be necessary for reasons of space to take a good
deal for granted, but this need not obscure the main ideas. First of all we may
suppose that the puzzle is somehow reduced to a mathematical form in the sort
of way that was used in the case of the knots. The position6 of the puzzle may be
described, as was done in that case, by sequences of symbols in a row. There is
usually very little diYculty in reducing other arrangements of symbols (e.g. the
squares in the sliding squares puzzle) to this form. The question which remains
to be answered is, ‘What sort of rules should one be allowed to have for
rearranging the symbols or counters?’ In order to answer this one needs to
think about what kinds of processes ever do occur in such rules, and, in order
to reduce their number, to break them up into simpler processes. Typical of such
processes are counting, copying, comparing, substituting. When one is doing
such processes, it is necessary, especially if there are many symbols involved, and
if one wishes to avoid carrying too much information in one’s head, either to
make a number of jottings elsewhere or to use a number of marker objects as well
as the pieces of the puzzle itself. For instance, if one were making a copy of a row
of counters concerned in the puzzle it would be as well to have a marker which
divided the pieces which have been copied from those which have not and
another showing the end of the portion to be copied. Now there is no reason
why the rules of the puzzle itself should not be expressed in such a way as to take
account of these markers. If one does express the rules in this way they can be
made to be just substitutions. This means to say that the normal form for puzzles
is the substitution type of puzzle. More deWnitely we can say:
   Given any puzzle we can Wnd a corresponding substitution puzzle which is
equivalent to it in the sense that given a solution of the one we can easily use it to
Wnd a solution of the other. If the original puzzle is concerned with rows of pieces of a
Wnite number of diVerent kinds, then the substitutions may be applied as an
alternative set of rules to the pieces of the original puzzle. A transformation can
be carried out by the rules of the original puzzle if and only if it can be carried out by
the substitutions and leads to a Wnal position from which all marker symbols have
disappeared.
   This statement is still somewhat lacking in deWniteness, and will remain so. I
do not propose, for instance, to enter here into the question as to what I mean by
the word ‘easily’. The statement is moreover one which one does not attempt to
prove. Propaganda is more appropriate to it than proof, for its status is some-
thing between a theorem and a deWnition. In so far as we know a priori what is a
puzzle and what is not, the statement is a theorem. In so far as we do not know
what puzzles are, the statement is a deWnition which tells us something about
what they are. One can of course deWne a puzzle by some phrase beginning, for
instance, ‘A set of deWnite rules . . .’, but this just throws us back on the deWnition

                          6 Editor’s note. Turing’s draft has ‘positions’.

                                                       Solvable and Unsolvable Problems | 589

of ‘deWnite rules’. Equally one can reduce it to the deWnition of ‘computable
function’ or ‘systematic procedure’. A deWnition of any one of these would deWne
all the rest. Since 1935 a number of deWnitions have been given, explaining in
detail the meaning of one or other of these terms, and these have all been proved
equivalent to one another and also equivalent to the above statement. In eVect
there is no opposition to the view that every puzzle is equivalent to a substitution
puzzle.7
   After these preliminaries let us think again about puzzles as a whole. First let
us recapitulate. There are a number of questions to which a puzzle may give rise.
When given a particular task one may ask quite simply
   (a) Can this be done?
   Such a straightforward question admits only the straightforward answers, ‘Yes’
or ‘No’, or perhaps ‘I don’t know’. In the case that the answer is ‘Yes’ the answerer
need only have done the puzzle himself beforehand to be sure. If the answer is to
be ‘No’, some rather more subtle kind of argument, more or less mathematical, is
necessary. For instance, in the case of the sliding squares one can state that the
impossible cases are impossible because of the mathematical fact that an odd
number of simple interchanges of a number of objects can never bring one back
to where one started. One may also be asked
   (b) What is the best way of doing this?
   Such a question does not admit of a straightforward answer. It depends partly
on individual diVerences in people’s ideas as to what they Wnd easy. If it is put in
the form, ‘What is the solution which involves the smallest number of steps?’, we
again have a straightforward question, but now it is one which is somehow
of remarkably little interest. In any particular case where the answer to (a) is
‘Yes’ one can Wnd the smallest possible number of steps by a tedious and
usually impracticable process of enumeration, but the result hardly justiWes the
labour.
   When one has been asked a number of times whether a number of diVerent
puzzles of similar nature can be solved one is naturally led to ask oneself
   (c) Is there a systematic procedure8 by which I can answer these questions, for
puzzles of this type?
   If one were feeling rather more ambitious one might even ask
   (d) Is there a systematic procedure8 by which one can tell whether a puzzle is
solvable?
   I hope to show that the answer to this last question is ‘No’.
   There are in fact certain types of puzzle for which the answer to (c) is ‘No’.

  7 Editor’s note. At this point Turing’s draft contains the following: ‘Some of these other deWnitions will be
found in Refs (1), (3), (11), (13), and (16) vol II. Some equivalence theorems are proved in (4) and (14), and
some propaganda on the matter will be found in (13). A very satisfactory account of all these problems will
be found in (5).’ Tantalizingly, the list of references is omitted.
  8 Editor’s note. Turing’s draft has ‘systematic method’.

590 | Alan Turing

   Before we can consider this question properly we shall need to be quite
clear what we mean by a ‘systematic procedure’8 for deciding a question.9 But
this need not now give us any particular diYculty. A ‘systematic procedure’
was one of the phrases which we mentioned as being equivalent to the idea of
a puzzle, because either could be reduced to the other. If we are now clear as
to what a puzzle is, then we should be equally clear about ‘systematic
procedures’. In fact a systematic procedure is just a puzzle in which there is
never more than one possible move in any of the positions which arise and in which
some signiWcance is attached to the Wnal result.
   Now that we have explained the meaning both of the term ‘puzzle’ and
of ‘systematic procedure’, we are in a position to prove the assertion made
in the Wrst paragraph of this article, that there cannot be any systematic pro-
cedure for determining whether a puzzle be solvable or not. The proof does
not really require the detailed deWnition of either of the terms, but only
the relation between them which we have just explained. Any systematic pro-
cedure for deciding whether a puzzle were solvable could certainly be
put in the form of a puzzle, with unambiguous moves (i.e. only one move
from any one position), and having for its starting position a combination
of the rules, the starting position and the Wnal position of the puzzle under
investigation.
   The puzzle under investigation is also to be described by its rules and starting
position. Each of these is to be just a row of symbols. As we are only considering
substitution puzzles, the rules need only be a list of all the substitution pairs
appropriately punctuated. One possible form of punctuation would be to separ-
ate the Wrst member of a pair from the second by an arrow, and to separate the
diVerent substitution pairs with colons. In this case the rules
                                      B may be replaced by BC
                                      WBW may be deleted
would be represented by ‘: B ! BC : WBW ! :’. For the purposes of the argu-
ment which follows, however, these arrows and colons are an embarrassment. We

   9 Editor’s note. At this point Turing’s draft contains the following material, which is crossed out. ‘It is a
phrase which, like many others e.g. ‘‘vegetable’’ one understands well enough in the ordinary way. But one
can have diYculties when speaking to greengrocers or microbiologists or when playing ‘‘twenty questions’’.
Are rhubarb and tomatoes vegetables or fruits? Is coal vegetable or mineral? What about coal gas, marrow,
fossilised trees, streptococci, viruses? Has the lettuce I ate at lunch yet become animal? The fact of the matter
is that when one is applying a word, say an adjective, to something deWnite, one chooses the word itself so
that it describes what one wants to describe fairly and squarely. If it doesn’t one had better look for another
word. But if one is playing twenty questions this just can’t be done. The questions are about ‘‘the object’’,
and one doesn’t know what it is. The same sort of diYculty arises about question c) above. An ordinary sort
of acquaintance with the meaning of the phrase ‘‘systematic method’’ won’t do, because one has got to be
able to say quite clearly about any kind of method that might be proposed whether it is allowable or not.
Fortunately a number of satisfactory deWnitions were found in the late thirties, and they have . . .’ [the
fragment ends at this point].

shall need the rules to be expressed without the use of any symbols which are
barred from appearing in the starting positions. This can be achieved by the
following simple, though slightly artiWcial trick. We Wrst double all the symbols
other than the punctuation symbols, thus ‘: BB ! BBCC : WWBBWW ! :’. We
then replace each arrow by a single symbol, which must be diVerent from those on
either side of it, and each colon by three similar symbols, also chosen to avoid
clashes. This can always be done if we have at least three symbols available, and the
rules above could then be represented as, for instance, ‘CCCBBWBBCC
BBBWWBBWWBWWW ’. Of course according to these conventions a great variety
of diVerent rows of symbols will describe essentially the same puzzle. Quite apart
from the arbitrary choice of the punctuating symbols the substitution pairs can be
given in any order, and the same pair can be repeated again and again.
   Now let P(R,S) stand for ‘the puzzle whose rules are described by the row of
symbols R and whose starting position is described by S’. Owing to the special
form in which we have chosen to describe the rules of puzzles, there is no reason
why we should not consider P(R,R) for which the ‘rules’ also serve as starting
position: in fact the success of the argument which follows depends on our doing
so. The argument will also be mainly concerned with puzzles in which there is at
most one possible move in any position; these may be called ‘puzzles with
unambiguous moves’. Such a puzzle may be said to have ‘come out’ if one
reaches either the position B or the position W, and the rules do not permit
any further moves. Clearly if a puzzle has unambiguous moves it cannot both
come out with the end result B and with the end result W.
   We now consider the problem of classifying rules R of puzzles into two classes,
I and II, as follows:
   Class I is to consist of sets R of rules, which represent puzzles with unambigu-
ous moves, and such that P(R,R) comes out with the end result W.
   Class II is to include all other cases, i.e. either P(R,R) does not come out, or
comes out with the end result B, or else R does not represent a puzzle with
unambiguous moves. We may also, if we wish, include in this class sequences of
symbols such as BBBBB which do not represent a set of rules at all.
   Now suppose that, contrary to the theorem that we wish to prove, we have a
systematic procedure for deciding whether puzzles come out or not. Then with
the aid of this procedure we shall be able to distinguish rules of class I from those
of class II. There is no diYculty in deciding whether R really represents a set of
rules, and whether they are unambiguous. If there is any diYculty it lies in
Wnding the end result in the cases where the puzzle is known to come out: but
this can be decided by actually working the puzzle through. By a principle which
has already been explained, this systematic procedure for distinguishing the two
classes can itself be put into the form of a substitution puzzle (with rules K, say).
When applying these rules K, the rules R of the puzzle under investigation form
the starting position, and the end result of the puzzle gives the result of the test.

592 | Alan Turing

Since the procedure always gives an answer, the puzzle P(K,R) always comes
out. The puzzle K might be made to announce its results in a variety of ways, and
we may be permitted to suppose that the end result is B for rules R of class I,
and W for rules of class II. The opposite choice would be equally possible, and
would hold for a slightly diVerent set of rules K 0 , which however we do not
choose to favour with our attention. The puzzle with rules K may without
diYculty be made to have unambiguous moves. Its essential properties are
therefore:
  K has unambiguous moves.
  P(K,R) always comes out whatever R.
  If R is in class I, then P(K,R) has end result B.
  If R is in class II, then P(K,R) has end result W.
These properties are however inconsistent with the deWnitions of the two classes.
If we ask ourselves which class K belongs to, we Wnd that neither will do. The
puzzle P(K,K) is bound to come out, but the properties of K tell us that we must
get end result B if K is in class I and W if it is in class II, whereas the deWnitions of
the classes tell us that the end results must be the other way round. The
assumption that there was a systematic procedure for telling whether puzzles
come out has thus been reduced to an absurdity.
   Thus in connexion with question (c) above we can say that there are some
types of puzzle for which no systematic method of deciding the question exists.
This is often expressed in the form, ‘There is no decision procedure for this type of
puzzle’, or again, ‘The decision problem for this type of puzzle is unsolvable’, and
so one comes to speak (as in the title of this article) about ‘unsolvable problems’
meaning in eVect puzzles for which there is no decision procedure. This is the
technical meaning which the words are now given by mathematical logicians. It
would seem more natural to use the phrase ‘unsolvable problem’ to mean just an
unsolvable puzzle, as for example ‘to transform 1, 2, 3 into 2, 1, 3 by cyclic
permutation of the symbols’, but this is not the meaning it now has. However, to
minimize confusion I shall here always speak of ‘unsolvable decision problems’,
rather than just ‘unsolvable problems’, and also speak of puzzles rather than
problems where it is puzzles and not decision problems that are concerned.
   It should be noticed that a decision problem only arises when one has an
inWnity of questions to ask. If you ask, ‘Is this apple good to eat?’, or ‘Is this
number prime?’, or ‘Is this puzzle solvable?’ the question can be settled with a
single ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. A Wnite number of answers will deal with a question about a
Wnite number of objects, such as the apples in a basket. When the number is
inWnite, or in some way not yet completed concerning say all the apples one may
ever be oVered, or all whole numbers or puzzles, a list of answers will not suYce.
Some kind of rule or systematic procedure must be given. Even if the number
concerned is Wnite one may still prefer to have a rule rather than a list: it may be

                                          Solvable and Unsolvable Problems | 593

easier to remember. But there certainly cannot be an unsolvable decision prob-
lem in such cases, because of the possibility of using Wnite list.
   Regarding decision problems as being concerned with classes of puzzles, we see
that if we have a decision method for one class it will apply also for any subclass.
Likewise, if we have proved that there is no decision procedure for the subclass, it
follows that there is none for the whole class. The most interesting and valuable
results about unsolvable decision problems concern the smaller classes of puzzle.
   Another point which is worth noticing is quite well illustrated by the puzzle
which we considered Wrst of all in which the pieces were sliding squares. If one
wants to know whether the puzzle is solvable with a given starting position, one
can try moving the pieces about in the hope of reaching the required end-
position. If one succeeds, then one will have solved the puzzle and consequently
will be able to answer the question, ‘Is it solvable?’ In the case that the puzzle is
solvable one will eventually come on the right set of moves. If one has also a
procedure by which, if the puzzle is unsolvable, one would eventually establish
the fact that it was so, then one would have a solution of the decision problem for
the puzzle. For it is only necessary to apply both processes, a bit of one alternat-
ing with a bit of the other, in order eventually to reach a conclusion by one or the
other. Actually, in the case of the sliding squares problem, we have got such a
procedure, for we know that if, by sliding, one ever reaches the required Wnal
position, with squares 14 and 15 interchanged, then the puzzle is impossible.
   It is clear then that the diYculty in Wnding decision procedures for types of
puzzle lies in establishing that the puzzle is unsolvable in those cases where it is
unsolvable. This, as was mentioned on page [589], requires some sort of math-
ematical argument. This suggests that we might try expressing the statement that
the puzzle comes out in a mathematical form and then try and prove it by some
systematic process. There is no particular diYculty in the Wrst part of this
project, the mathematical expression of the statement about the puzzle. But
the second half of the project is bound to fail, because by a famous theorem of
Gödel no systematic method of proving mathematical theorems is suYciently
complete to settle every mathematical question, yes or no. In any case we are now
in a position to give an independent proof of this. If there were such a systematic
method of proving mathematical theorems we could apply it to our puzzles and
for each one eventually either prove that it was solvable or unsolvable; this would
provide a systematic method of determining whether the puzzle was solvable or
not, contrary to what we have already proved.
   This result about the decision problem for puzzles, or, more accurately
speaking, a number of others very similar to it, was proved in 1936–7. Since
then a considerable number of further decision problems have been shown to be
unsolvable. They are all proved to be unsolvable by showing that if they were
solvable one could use the solution to provide a solution of the original one.
They could all without diYculty be reduced to the same unsolvable problem. A

number of these results are mentioned very shortly below. No attempt is made to
explain the technical terms used, as most readers will be familiar with some of
them, and the space required for the explanation would be quite out of propor-
tion to its usefulness in this context.
  (1) It is not possible to solve the decision problem even for substitution
      processes applied to rows of black and white counters only.
  (2) There are certain particular puzzles for which there is no decision proced-
      ure, the rules being Wxed and the only variable element being the starting
      position.
  (3) There is no procedure for deciding whether a given set of axioms leads to
      a contradiction or not.
  (4) The ‘word problem in semi-groups with cancellation’ is not solvable.
  (5) It has recently been announced from Russia that the ‘word problem in
      groups’ is not solvable. This is a decision problem not unlike the ‘word
      problem in semi-groups’, but very much more important, having applica-
      tions in topology: attempts were being made to solve this decision prob-
      lem before any such problems had been proved unsolvable. No adequately
      complete proof is yet available, but if it is correct this is a considerable step
      forward.
  (6) There is a set of 102 matrices of order 4, with integral coeYcients such
      that there is no decision method for determining whether another given
      matrix is or is not expressible as a product of matrices from the given set.
   These are, of course, only a selection from the results. Although quite a
number of decision problems are now known to be unsolvable, we are still
very far from being in a position to say of a given decision problem, whether
it is solvable or not. Indeed, we shall never be quite in that position, for
the question whether a given decision problem is solvable is itself one of the
undecidable decision problems. The results which have been found are on
the whole ones which have fallen into our laps rather than ones which have
positively been searched for. Considerable eVorts have however been made over
the word problem in groups (see (5) above). Another problem which mathem-
aticians are very anxious to settle is known as ‘the decision problem of the
equivalence of manifolds’. This is something like one of the problems we have
already mentioned, that concerning the twisted wire puzzles. But whereas with
the twisted wire puzzles the pieces are quite rigid, the ‘equivalence of manifolds’
problem concerns pieces which one is allowed to bend, stretch, twist, or com-
press as much as one likes, without ever actually breaking them or making new
junctions or Wlling in holes. Given a number of interlacing pieces of plasticine
one may be asked to transform them in this way into another given form. The
decision problem for this class of problem is the ‘decision problem for the
equivalence of manifolds’. It is probably unsolvable, but has never been proved

                                          Solvable and Unsolvable Problems | 595

to be so. A similar decision problem which might well be unsolvable is the one
concerning knots which has already been mentioned.
   The results which have been described in this article are mainly of a negative
character, setting certain bounds to what we can hope to achieve purely by
reasoning. These, and some other results of mathematical logic may be regarded
as going some way towards a demonstration, within mathematics itself, of the
inadequacy of ‘reason’ unsupported by common sense.
