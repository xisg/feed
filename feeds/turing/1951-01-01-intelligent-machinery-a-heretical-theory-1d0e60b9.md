Introduction
Jack Copeland

The ’51 Society
Turing gave the presentation ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ on a
radio discussion programme called The ’51 Society. Named after the year in which
the programme Wrst went to air, The ’51 Society was produced by the BBC Home
Service at their Manchester studio and ran for several years.1 A presentation by the
week’s guest would be followed by a panel discussion. Regulars on the panel
included Max Newman, Professor of Mathematics at Manchester, the philosopher
Michael Polanyi, then Professor of Social Studies at Manchester, and the math-
ematician Peter Hilton, a younger member of Newman’s department at Manches-
ter who had worked with Turing and Newman at Bletchley Park.

Machine Learning
Turing’s target in ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ is the claim that
‘You cannot make a machine to think for you’ (p. 472). A common theme in his
writing is that if a machine is to be intelligent, then it will need to ‘learn by
experience’ (probably with some pre-selection, by an external educator, of the
experiences to which the machine will be subjected). The present article con-
tinues the discussion of machine learning begun in Chapters 10 and 11. Turing
remarks that the ‘human analogy alone’ suggests that a process of education
‘would in practice be an essential to the production of a reasonably intelligent
machine within a reasonably short space of time’ (p. 473). He emphasizes the

                   1 Peter Hilton in interview with Copeland (June 2001).

point, also made in Chapter 11, that one might ‘start from a comparatively
simple machine, and, by subjecting it to a suitable range of ‘‘experience’’ trans-
form it into one which was more elaborate, and was able to deal with a far greater
range of contingencies’ (p. 473).
   Turing goes on to give some indication of how learning might be accom-
plished, introducing the idea of a machine’s building up what he calls ‘indexes of
experiences’ (p. 474). (This idea is not mentioned elsewhere in his writings.) An
example of an index of experiences is a list (ordered in some way) of situations in
which the machine has found itself, coupled with the action that was taken, and
the outcome, good or bad. The situations are described in terms of features.
Faced with a choice as to what to do next, the machine looks up features of its
present situation in whatever indexes it has. If this procedure aVords more than
one candidate action, the machine selects between them by means of some rule,
possibly itself learned through experience. Turing very reasonably grounds his
belief that comparatively crude selection-rules will lead to satisfactory behaviour
in the fact that engineering problems are regularly solved by ‘the crudest rule of
thumb procedure . . . e.g. whether a function increases or decreases with one of its
variables’ (p. 474).
   In response to the problem of how the educator is to indicate to the machine
whether a situation or outcome is a ‘favourable’ one or not, Turing returns to the
possibility of incorporating two ‘keys’ in the machine, which can be manipulated
by the educator, and which represent ‘pleasure’ and ‘pain’ (p. 474). This is an
idea that Turing discusses more fully in Chapter 10, where he considers adding
two input lines to a (modiWed) Turing machine, the pleasure (or reward) line
and the pain (or punishment) line. He calls the result a ‘P-type machine’
(‘P’ standing for ‘pleasure–pain’).2

Random Elements
Turing ends his discussion of machine learning with the suggestion that a
‘random element’ be incorporated in the machine (p. 475). This would, as he
says, result in the behaviour of the machine being by no means completely
determined by the experiences to which it was subjected (p. 475). The idea
that a random element be included in a learning machine appears elsewhere in
Turing’s discussions of machine intelligence. In Chapter 11 he says: ‘A random
element is rather useful when . . . searching for a solution of some problem’
(p. 463). He gives this example:

  2 A detailed description of Turing’s P-type machines is given in B. J. Copeland and D. Proudfoot, ‘On
Alan Turing’s Anticipation of Connectionism’, Synthese, 108 (1996), 361–77 (reprinted in R. Chrisley (ed.),
ArtiWcial Intelligence: Critical Concepts in Cognitive Science, ii: Symbolic AI (London: Routledge, 2000)).

Suppose for instance we wanted to Wnd a number between 50 and 200 which was equal to
the square of the sum of its digits, we might start at 51 then try 52 and so on until we got
a number that worked. Alternatively we might choose numbers at random until we got a
good one.

  Turing continues (p. 463):
The systematic method has the disadvantage that there may be an enormous block
without any solutions in the region which has to be investigated Wrst. Now the learning
process may be regarded as a search for a form of behaviour which will satisfy the teacher
(or some other criterion). Since there is probably a very large number of satisfactory
solutions the random method seems to be better than the systematic. It should be noticed
that it is used in the analogous process of evolution.

  Turing’s discussion of ‘pleasure–pain systems’ in Chapter 10 also mentions
randomness (p. 425):
I will use this term [‘pleasure–pain’ system] to mean an unorganised machine of the
following general character: The conWgurations of the machine are described by two
expressions, which we may call the character-expression and the situation-expression.
The character and situation at any moment, together with the input signals, determine the
character and situation at the next moment. The character may be subject to some
random variation. Pleasure interference has a tendency to Wx the character i.e. towards
preventing it changing, whereas pain stimuli tend to disrupt the character, causing
features which had become Wxed to change, or to become again subject to random
variation.

The Mathematical Objection
In what are some of the most interesting remarks in ‘Intelligent Machinery, A
Heretical Theory’, Turing sketches and rebuts an argument against the possibility
of computing machines emulating the full intelligence of human beings. The
objection is stated as follows in Chapter 10 (pp. 410–11):
Recently the theorem of Gödel and related results . . . have shown that if one tries to use
machines for such purposes as determining the truth or falsity of mathematical theorems
and one is not willing to tolerate an occasional wrong result, then any given machine will
in some cases be unable to give an answer at all. On the other hand the human intelligence
seems to be able to Wnd methods of ever-increasing power for dealing with such problems
‘transcending’ the methods available to machines.

In Chapter 11 he terms this the ‘Mathematical Objection’ (p. 450).
  As Turing notes, the ‘related results’ include what he himself proved in ‘On
Computable Numbers’. The import of the satisfactoriness problem (explained in
‘Computable Numbers: A Guide’) is that no Turing machine can correctly
determine the truth or falsity of each statement of the form ‘such-and-such

468 | Jack Copeland

Turing machine is circle-free’. Whichever Turing machine one chooses to ask,
there will be statements of this form for which the chosen machine either gives
no answer or gives the wrong answer (compare Chapter 11, pp. 450–1). (In
Chapter 3, Turing extends this result to his oracle machines: no oracle machine
can correctly determine the truth or falsity of each statement of the form ‘such-
and-such oracle machine is circle-free’ (pp. 156–7).)
   Post formulated a version of the Mathematical Objection as early as 1921.3
However, the objection has become known over the years as the ‘Gödel argu-
ment’. In 1961, in a famous article, the philosopher John Lucas claimed the Gödel
argument establishes that ‘mechanism’—which Lucas characterizes as the view
that ‘minds [can] be explained as machines’—is false.4 More recently, the
mathematical physicist Roger Penrose has endorsed a version of the Gödel
argument.5
   Lucas was happy to assert, on the basis of the Mathematical Objection, that
‘no scientiWc enquiry can ever exhaust the . . . human mind’.6 Not many who
admire the explanatory power of science would be happy to endorse this
conclusion. Penrose himself appears to hold that the mind can be explained in
ultimately physical terms. However, it is diYcult to say what scientiWc concep-
tion of the mind could be available to someone who endorses the Mathematical
Objection. This is because the objection, if sound, could be used equally well to
support the conclusion, not only that the mind is not a Turing machine, but also
that it is not any one of a very broad range of machines (which includes the
oracle machines). Given the enormous diversity of types of machine in this
range, it is an open question whether there is any scientiWc conception of the
mind that the Mathematical Objection (if sound) would not rule out.7
   Penrose acknowledges that the objection applies not only to the view that the
mind is equivalent to a Turing machine but ‘much more generally’, saying: ‘No
doubt there are readers who believe that the last vestige of credibility of my
[version of the Gödel] argument has disappeared at this stage! I certainly should
not blame any reader for feeling this way.’8
   So far, however, Penrose has not made it clear what scientiWc conception of the
mind can remain for one who endorses the argument, remarking only that, since

the argument ‘can be applied in very general circumstances indeed’, the mind is
‘something very mysterious’.9

Turing’s Answer to the Mathematical Objection
In Chapter 11 Turing says (p. 451): ‘The short answer to this argument is that
although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particu-
lar machine, it has only been stated, without any sort of proof, that no such
limitations apply to the human intellect.’ This remark might appear to cut to the
heart of the matter. However, Turing expresses dissatisfaction with it, saying that
the Mathematical Objection cannot ‘be dismissed so lightly’. He goes on to
broach a further line of attack on the argument, pointing out that humans
‘often give wrong answers to questions’, and it is this line of attack that he
pursues in ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’.
   In the quotation from Chapter 10 given above, Turing notes that the Math-
ematical Objection rests on a proviso that the machine is not allowed to make
mistakes, and as he goes on to point out, ‘the condition that the machine must
not make mistakes . . . is not a requirement for intelligence’ (p. 411). In ‘Intelli-
gent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ he suggests that the ‘danger of the math-
ematician making mistakes is an unavoidable corollary of his power of
sometimes hitting upon an entirely new method’ (p. 472). Turing envisages
machines also able to hit upon new methods: ‘My contention is that machines
can be constructed which will simulate the behaviour of the human mind very
closely. They will make mistakes at times, and at times they may make new and
very interesting statements.’
   Turing makes a similar point in Chapter 9 (pp. 393–4):
[I]f a mathematician is confronted with such a problem [e.g. determining the truth or
falsity of statements of the form ‘p is provable in such-and-such system’—Ed.] he would
search around and Wnd new methods of proof, so that he ought eventually to be able to
reach a decision about any given formula. . . . I would say that fair play must be given
to the machine. Instead of it sometimes giving no answer we could arrange that it
gives occasional wrong answers. But the human mathematician would likewise make
blunders when trying out new techniques. It is easy for us to regard these blunders as
not counting and give him another chance, but the machine would probably be allowed
no mercy.

  The use of heuristic search carries with it the risk of the computer producing a
proportion of incorrect answers (see ‘ArtiWcial Intelligence’). This fact would
have been very familiar to Turing from his experience with the bombe. Probably
Turing was thinking of heuristic search when he wrote this, the earliest surviving

                      9 ‘Beyond the Doubting of a Shadow’, section 13.2.

statement of his views concerning machine intelligence, in ‘Proposed Electronic
Calculator’: ‘There are indications however that it is possible to make the
machine display intelligence at the risk of its making occasional serious mistakes.
By following up this aspect the machine could probably be made to play very
good chess.’10
   In ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ Turing passes immediately from
his remarks on the Mathematical Objection to a discussion of machine learning.
This juxtaposition perhaps indicates that Turing’s view was this: it is the possi-
bility of a machine’s learning new methods and techniques that ultimately defeats
the Mathematical Objection. In the simplest possible case, the machine’s tutor—
a human mathematician—can just present the machine with a better method
whenever the machine produces an incorrect answer to a problem. This new
input in eVect alters the machine’s standard description, transforming it into a
diVerent Turing machine (see ‘Computable Numbers: A Guide’). Alternatively a
machine may itself be able to search around (albeit fallibly) for better methods.
The search might involve the use of a random element. As in the preceding case,
the standard description of the machine alters in consequence of the learning
process, as the machine overwrites its previous algorithm with a successor. (As
Turing says in Chapter 9: ‘What we want is a machine that can learn from
experience. The possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions
provides the mechanism for this.’) Thus the learning machine may traverse the
space of what in one of his letters to Newman (Chapter 4, p. 215) Turing calls
‘proof Wnding’ machines. In the same letter Turing says:
One imagines diVerent machines allowing diVerent sets of proofs, and by choosing a
suitable machine one can approximate ‘truth’ by ‘provability’ better than with a less
suitable machine, and can in a sense approximate it as well as you please.

  The learning machine successively mutates from one proof-Wnding Turing
machine into another, becoming capable of wider sets of proofs as new, more
powerful methods of proof are acquired.

The Future
Turing ends ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’ with a vision of the
future, now hackneyed, in which intelligent computers ‘outstrip our feeble
powers’ and ‘take control’. There is more of the same in Chapter 13. No doubt
this is comic-strip stuV. Nevertheless, these images of Turing’s reveal his pro-
found grasp of the potential of the universal Turing machine at a time when the

only computers in existence were minuscule, and none but the most straightfor-
ward of tasks had been successfully programmed.11

Provenance
The text that follows is from a typescript entitled ‘Intelligent Machinery, A
Heretical Theory’ and marked ‘Typist’s Typescript’.12

   11 In this chapter Turing speaks of the ‘mechanic who has constructed the machine’. This is perhaps a
glimpse of Turing’s attitude toward Kilburn, Williams, and the other engineers who built the Manchester
computer. Kilburn himself was hardly less dismissive of the logicians’ contributions (for example in an
interview with Christopher Evans in 1976, ‘The Pioneers of Computing: An Oral History of Computing’
(London: Science Museum)).
   12 The typescript is among the Turing Papers in the Modern Archive Centre, King’s College, Cambridge
(catalogue reference B 4). Turing’s mother Sara included the text of ‘Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical
Theory’ in her biography Alan M. Turing but unfortunately incorporated some errors (S. Turing, Alan M.
Turing (Cambridge: HeVer, 1959), 128–34.) The present edition Wrst appeared in B. J. Copeland (ed.),
‘A Lecture and Two Radio Broadcasts on Machine Intelligence by Alan Turing’, in K. Furukawa, D. Michie,
and S. Muggleton (eds.), Machine Intelligence 15 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999).

Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory
‘You cannot make a machine to think for you.’ This is a commonplace that is
usually accepted without question. It will be the purpose of this paper to
question it.
   Most machinery developed for commercial purposes is intended to carry out
some very speciWc job, and to carry it out with certainty and considerable speed.
Very often it does the same series of operations over and over again without any
variety. This fact about the actual machinery available is a powerful argument to
many in favour of the slogan quoted above. To a mathematical logician this
argument is not available, for it has been shown that there are machines
theoretically possible which will do something very close to thinking. They
will, for instance, test the validity of a formal proof in the system of Principia
Mathematica, or even tell of a formula of that system whether it is provable or
disprovable. In the case that the formula is neither provable nor disprovable such
a machine certainly does not behave in a very satisfactory manner, for it
continues to work indeWnitely without producing any result at all, but this
cannot be regarded as very diVerent from the reaction of the mathematicians,
who have for instance worked for hundreds of years on the question as to
whether Fermat’s last theorem is true or not. For the case of machines of this
kind a more subtle argument is necessary. By Gödel’s famous theorem, or some
similar argument, one can show that however the machine is constructed there
are bound to be cases where the machine fails to give an answer, but a mathem-
atician would be able to. On the other hand, the machine has certain advantages
over the mathematician. Whatever it does can be relied upon, assuming no
mechanical ‘breakdown’, whereas the mathematician makes a certain proportion
of mistakes. I believe that this danger of the mathematician making mistakes is
an unavoidable corollary of his power of sometimes hitting upon an entirely new
method. This seems to be conWrmed by the well known fact that the most reliable
people will not usually hit upon really new methods.
   My contention is that machines can be constructed which will simulate the
behaviour of the human mind very closely. They will make mistakes at times, and
at times they may make new and very interesting statements, and on the whole
the output of them will be worth attention to the same sort of extent as the
output of a human mind. The content of this statement lies in the greater
frequency expected for the true statements, and it cannot, I think, be given an
exact statement. It would not, for instance, be suYcient to say simply that the
machine will make any true statement sooner or later, for an example of such a
machine would be one which makes all possible statements sooner or later. We

             Printed with the permission of the BBC and the Estate of Alan Turing.

                                   Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory | 473

know how to construct these, and as they would (probably) produce true and
false statements about equally frequently, their verdicts would be quite worthless.
It would be the actual reaction of the machine to circumstances that would prove
my contention, if indeed it can be proved at all.
   Let us go rather more carefully into the nature of this ‘proof ’. It is clearly
possible to produce a machine which would give a very good account of itself for
any range of tests, if the machine were made suYciently elaborate. However, this
again would hardly be considered an adequate proof. Such a machine would give
itself away by making the same sort of mistake over and over again, and being
quite unable to correct itself, or to be corrected by argument from outside. If the
machine were able in some way to ‘learn by experience’ it would be much more
impressive. If this were the case there seems to be no real reason why one should
not start from a comparatively simple machine, and, by subjecting it to a suitable
range of ‘experience’ transform it into one which was more elaborate, and was
able to deal with a far greater range of contingencies. This process could probably
be hastened by a suitable selection of the experiences to which it was subjected.
This might be called ‘education’. But here we have to be careful. It would be quite
easy to arrange the experiences in such a way that they automatically caused the
structure of the machine to build up into a previously intended form, and this
would obviously be a gross form of cheating, almost on a par with having a man
inside the machine. Here again the criterion as to what would be considered
reasonable in the way of ‘education’ cannot be put into mathematical terms, but
I suggest that the following would be adequate in practice. Let us suppose that it
is intended that the machine shall understand English, and that owing to its
having no hands or feet, and not needing to eat, nor desiring to smoke, it will
occupy its time mostly in playing games such as Chess and GO, and possibly
Bridge. The machine is provided with a typewriter keyboard on which any
remarks to it are typed, and it also types out any remarks that it wishes to
make. I suggest that the education of the machine should be entrusted to some
highly competent schoolmaster who is interested in the project but who is
forbidden any detailed knowledge of the inner workings of the machine. The
mechanic who has constructed the machine, however, is permitted to keep the
machine in running order, and if he suspects that the machine has been operat-
ing incorrectly may put it back to one of its previous positions and ask the
schoolmaster to repeat his lessons from that point on, but he may not take any
part in the teaching. Since this procedure would only serve to test the bona Wdes
of the mechanic, I need hardly say that it would not be adopted in the experi-
mental stages. As I see it, this education process would in practice be an essential
to the production of a reasonably intelligent machine within a reasonably short
space of time. The human analogy alone suggests this.
   I may now give some indication of the way in which such a machine might be
expected to function. The machine would incorporate a memory. This does not

474 | Alan Turing

need very much explanation. It would simply be a list of all the statements that
had been made to it or by it, and all the moves it had made and the cards it had
played in its games. This would be listed in chronological order. Besides this
straightforward memory there would be a number of ‘indexes of experiences’. To
explain this idea I will suggest the form which one such index might possibly
take. It might be an alphabetical index of the words that had been used giving the
‘times’ at which they had been used, so that they could be looked up in the
memory. Another such index might contain patterns of men on parts of a GO
board that had occurred. At comparatively late stages of education the memory
might be extended to include important parts of the conWguration of the
machine at each moment, or in other words it would begin to remember what
its thoughts had been. This would give rise to fruitful new forms of indexing.
New forms of index might be introduced on account of special features observed
in the indexes already used. The indexes would be used in this sort of way.
Whenever a choice has to be made as to what to do next, features of the present
situation are looked up in the indexes available, and the previous choice in the
similar situations, and the outcome, good or bad, is discovered. The new choice
is made accordingly. This raises a number of problems. If some of the indications
are favourable and some are unfavourable what is one to do? The answer to this
will probably diVer from machine to machine and will also vary with its degree of
education. At Wrst probably some quite crude rule will suYce, e.g. to do
whichever has the greatest number of votes in its favour. At a very late stage of
education the whole question of procedure in such cases will probably have been
investigated by the machine itself, by means of some kind of index, and this may
result in some highly sophisticated, and, one hopes, highly satisfactory, form of
rule. It seems probable however that the comparatively crude forms of rule will
themselves be reasonably satisfactory, so that progress can on the whole be made
in spite of the crudeness of the choice [of] rules.1 This seems to be veriWed by the
fact that engineering problems are sometimes solved by the crudest rule of
thumb procedure which only deals with the most superWcial aspects of the
problem, e.g. whether a function increases or decreases with one of its variables.
Another problem raised by this picture of the way behaviour is determined is the
idea of ‘favourable outcome’. Without some such idea, corresponding to the
‘pleasure principle’ of the psychologists, it is very diYcult to see how to proceed.
Certainly it would be most natural to introduce some such thing into the
machine. I suggest that there should be two keys which can be manipulated by
the schoolmaster, and which represent the ideas of pleasure and pain. At later
stages in education the machine would recognise certain other conditions as
desirable owing to their having been constantly associated in the past with
pleasure, and likewise certain others as undesirable. Certain expressions of

         1 Editor’s note. Words enclosed in square brackets do not appear in the typescript.

anger on the part of the schoolmaster might, for instance, be recognised as so
ominous that they could never be overlooked, so that the schoolmaster would
Wnd that it became unnecessary to ‘apply the cane’ any more.
   To make further suggestions along these lines would perhaps be unfruitful at
this stage, as they are likely to consist of nothing more than an analysis of actual
methods of education applied to human children. There is, however, one feature
that I would like to suggest should be incorporated in the machines, and that is
a ‘random element’. Each machine should be supplied with a tape bearing a
random series of Wgures, e.g. 0 and 1 in equal quantities, and this series of Wgures
should be used in the choices made by the machine. This would result in the
behaviour of the machine not being by any means completely determined by the
experiences to which it was subjected, and would have some valuable uses when
one was experimenting with it. By faking the choices made one would be able to
control the development of the machine to some extent. One might, for instance,
insist on the choice made being a particular one at, say, 10 particular places, and
this would mean that about one machine in 1024 or more would develop to as
high a degree as the one which had been faked. This cannot very well be given an
accurate statement because of the subjective nature of the idea of ‘degree of
development’ to say nothing of the fact that the machine that had been faked
might have been also fortunate in its unfaked choices.
   Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that these machines are a
genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them. To do
so would of course meet with great opposition, unless we have advanced greatly
in religious toleration from the days of Galileo. There would be great opposition
from the intellectuals who were afraid of being put out of a job. It is probable
though that the intellectuals would be mistaken about this. There would be
plenty to do, [trying to understand what the machines were trying to say,]2 i.e.
in trying to keep one’s intelligence up to the standard set by the machines, for it
seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not
take long to outstrip our feeble powers. There would be no question of the
machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen
their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take
control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler’s ‘Erewhon’.
