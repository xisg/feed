# Asynchronous clean-up

One problem with the design of async Rust is what do about async clean-up code. Consider that you
have a type representing some object or operation (like an async IO handle) and it runs clean up
code when you are done using it, but that clean up code itself is also non-blocking and could yield
control. Async Rust has no good way to handle this pattern today.

The nicest solution seems to be to just use the mechanism that already exists: destructors. If only
you could `await` inside a destructor, everything would seem to be solved. Alas, this would present
several problems, and I personally do not believe it is realistic to imagine Rust gaining this
feature in the same way that destructors work.

The first problem is this: what happens if you drop the the value in a non-async scope? It’s not
possible to `await` there! There are two options: either the async destructor doesn’t run
(considered too easy a mistake to make), or there is a type-checking rule that prevents users from
dropping values with async destructors in non-async scopes. The second solution reduces to
undroppable types, which I will discuss later in this post: this rule is just undroppable types with
an exception to allow them to be dropped in an async scope. What I can say with certainty is that
undroppable types, even with an exception, would be very difficult to add to Rust.

The second problem is the way that the state of the async destructor would impact the state of any
future any containing it. This is actually a re-emergence of the problems with async methods, but
now applied to any generic type (because you don’t know of a generic type `T` has an async
destructor). The first problem is that you have any trait object, when it drops, what happens if it
has an async destructor? This introduces the same object safety issues as async methods: you have
nowhere to store the future returned by the async destructor of a trait object. The second problem
is that you want to send a value to a different thread, that state of its async destructor also
needs to be `Send`. This is the same problem that motivated RTN, except that now its a problem for
_every_ generic type being moved to another thread, not only types on which you explicitly call an
async method. I wrote about this problem years and years ago, but it seems to have been
misunderstood and ignored since then.

The third problem is that users are concerned about having implicit await points added to their
future without them realizing it. Therefore there would need to be some restriction that not only
doesn’t allow these types to be dropped in a non-async scope, but also makes it so that they are
destructed at an already explicit `await` point. This would make the rules around when their async
destructors run very different from other destructors, if its even possible to make them coherent.

The fourth problem, I believe maybe never raised before, is that it is not the ideal code generation
to run async destructors sequentially no matter what. For example, if I have two values that I am
asynchronously dropping, possibly I want to `join` the destructors so they run concurrently. But
doing this implicitly would be very risky, because maybe I actually carefully expect one to run
before the other.

All of these problems hint at a different way to frame the problem of asynchronous clean-up: the
problem is not that there is no async drop, but that destructors really only work when you can write
a destructor function that returns `()`. Async clean-up is just a special case of clean-up which
does not return `()`. In this case it returns a future, but there are also scenarios in which the
issue is a lack of destructors that can return `Result`, for example.

I want to explore the design space for asynchronous clean up and clean up code that returns values
in general, without a focus on destructors specifically. The proposal I’ve fleshed out here, based
heavily on the work of others (especially Eric Holk and Tyler Mandry), combines two distinct
features - async future cancellation and a `do` … `final` construct - to enable users to write
asynchronous clean up code that is consistently called. I will also show how these constructs are
required for any sort of “linear type” mechanism in Rust, so rather than seeing them as alternative
to type-based async clean up code, they should be seen as prerequisites that can be implemented in
the nearer term.
