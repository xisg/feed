# References are like jumps

> In a high-level language, the programmer is deprived of the dangerous power to update his own
> program while it is running. Even more valuable, he has the power to split his machine into a
> number of separate variables, arrays, files, etc.; when he wishes to update any of these he must
> quote its name explicitly on the left of the assignment, so that the identity of the part of the
> machine subject to change is immediately apparent; and, finally, a high-level language can
> guarantee that all variables are disjoint, and that updating any one of them cannot possibly have
> any effect on any other.
>
> Unfortunately, many of these advantages are not maintained in the design of procedures and
> parameters in ALGOL 60 and other languages. But instead of mending these minor faults, many
> language designers have preferred to extend them throughout the whole language by introducing the
> concept of reference, pointer, or indirect address into the language as an assignable item of
> data. This immediately gives rise in a high-level language to one of the most notorious confusions
> of machine code, namely that between an address and its contents. Some languages attempt to solve
> this by even more confusing automatic coercion rules. Worst still, an indirect assignment through
> a pointer, just as in machine code, can update any store location whatsoever, and the damage is no
> longer confined to the variable explicitly named as the target of assignment…

— C.A.R. Hoare, _Hints on programming-language design_ 1974

How embarrassing it is for the practice of software development that, when it comes to the subject
of references, we have spent half a century creating an enormous object proof that Sir Tony was
correct. Null pointers may have been his [billion dollar mistake](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/), but the decision to
ignore his remarks about the problem of pointers in general was a trillion dollar mistake that
everyone else made.

What Tony Hoare was writing about when he said that references are like jumps was the problem of
_mutable, aliased state._ If you have in a language the ability to alias two variables so that they
refer to the same location in memory, and also the ability to assign values to variables as
execution progresses, your ability to locally reason about the behavior of a component of your
system becomes badly inhibited. Depriving the user of the ability to mutate aliased state
by accident is critical to enabling the user to easily create correctly functioning systems.
