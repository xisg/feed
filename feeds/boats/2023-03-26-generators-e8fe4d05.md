# Generators

One of the main emphases of my recent posts has been that I believe shipping generators would solve
a lot of user problems by making it easy to write imperative iterative code, and especially to make
that iterative code interact well with asynchrony and fallibility as well. One thing that frustrates
me about the situation is that generators have been nearly ready to ship for years now, but very
little visible progress has been made. In particular, the core compiler transform to take a
generator and produce a state machine already exists, because it’s exactly how async functions are
implemented.
