We have seen amazing progress in NLP in 2018. Large-scale pre-trained language modes like [OpenAI GPT](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) have achieved great performance on a variety of language tasks using generic model architectures. The idea is similar to how ImageNet classification pre-training helps many vision tasks (\*). Even better than vision classification pre-training, this simple and powerful approach in NLP does not require labeled data for pre-training, allowing us to experiment with increased training scale, up to our very limit.
