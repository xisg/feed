# Learning with not Enough Data Part 3: Data Generation

Here comes the Part 3 on learning with not enough data (Previous: [Part 1](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-12-05-semi-supervised/) and [Part 2](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2022-02-20-active-learning/)). Let’s consider two approaches for generating synthetic data for training.

- **Augmented data**. Given a set of existing training samples, we can apply a variety of augmentation, distortion and transformation to derive new data points without losing the key attributes. We have covered a bunch of augmentation methods on text and images in a [previous post](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/) on contrastive learning. For the sake of post completeness, I *duplicate* the section on data augmentation here with some edits.
- **New data**. Given few or even no data points, we can rely on powerful pretrained models to generate a number of *new* data points. This is especially true in recent years given the fast progress in large pretrained [language models (LM)](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2019-01-31-lm/). Few shot prompting is shown to be effective for LM to learn within context without extra training.

# Data Augmentation

The goal of data augmentation is to modify the input format (e.g. text wording, visual appearance) while the semantic meaning stays unchanged.
