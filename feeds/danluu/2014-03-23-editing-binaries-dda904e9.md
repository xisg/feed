# Editing binaries

Editing binaries is a trick that comes in handy a few times a year. You don't often need to, but when you do, there's no alternative. When I mention patching binaries, I get one of two reactions: complete shock or no reaction at all. As far as I can tell, this is because most people have one of these two models of the world:

> 1. There exists source code. Compilers do something to source code to make it runnable. If you change the source code, different things happen.
>
> 2. There exists a processor. The processor takes some bits and decodes them to make things happen. If you change the bits, different things happen.

If you have the first view, breaking out a hex editor to modify a program is the action of a deranged lunatic. If you have the second view, editing binaries is the most natural thing in the world. Why wouldn't you just edit the binary? It's often the easiest way to get what you need.

For instance, you're forced to do this all the time if you use a [non-Intel non-AMD x86 processor](http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=26351). Instead of checking [CPUID feature flags, programs will check the CPUID family, model, and stepping](http://www.sandpile.org/x86/cpuid.htm) to determine features, which results in incorrect behavior on non-standard CPUs. Sometimes you have to do an edit to get the program to use the latest SSE instructions and sometimes you have to do an edit to get the program to run at all. You can try filing a bug, but it's much [easier to just edit your binaries](https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=2508).

Even if you're running on a mainstream Intel CPU, these tricks are useful when you run into [bugs in closed sourced software](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/11/13/10367904.aspx?Redirected=true). And then there are emergencies.

The other day, a DevOps friend of mine at a mid-sized startup told me about the time they released an internal alpha build externally, which caused their auto-update mechanism to replace everyone's working binary with a buggy experimental version. It only took a minute to figure out what happened. Updates gradually roll out to all users over a couple days, which meant that the bad version had only spread to `1 / (60*24*2) = 0.03%` of all users. But they couldn't push the old version into the auto-updater because the client only accepts updates from higher numbered versions. They had to go through the entire build and release process (an hour long endeavor) just to release a version that was identical to their last good version. If it had occurred to anyone to edit the binary to increment the version number, they could have pushed out a good update in a minute instead of an hour, which would have kept the issue from spreading to more than `0.06%` of their users, instead of sending `2%` of their users a broken update[1](#fn:E).

This isn't nearly as hard as it sounds. Let's try an example. If you're going to do this sort of thing regularly, you probably want to use a real disassembler like [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) [2](#fn:D). But, you can get by with simple tools if you only need to do this every once in a while. I happen to be on a Mac that I don't use for development, so I'm going to use [lldb](http://lldb.llvm.org/) for disassembly and [HexFiend](http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/) to edit this example. Gdb, otool, and objdump also work fine for quick and dirty disassembly.

Here's a toy code snippet, `wat-arg.c`, that should be easy to binary edit:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if (argc > 1) {
    printf("got an arg\n");
  } else {
    printf("no args\n");
  }
}

```

If we compile this and then launch lldb on the binary and step into main, we can see the following machine code:

```
$ lldb wat-arg
(lldb) breakpoint set -n main
Breakpoint 1: where = original`main, address = 0x0000000100000ee0
(lldb) run
(lldb) disas -b -p -c 20
;  address       hex opcode            disassembly
-> 0x100000ee0:  55                    pushq  %rbp
   0x100000ee1:  48 89 e5              movq   %rsp, %rbp
   0x100000ee4:  48 83 ec 20           subq   $32, %rsp
   0x100000ee8:  c7 45 fc 00 00 00 00  movl   $0, -4(%rbp)
   0x100000eef:  89 7d f8              movl   %edi, -8(%rbp)
   0x100000ef2:  48 89 75 f0           movq   %rsi, -16(%rbp)
   0x100000ef6:  81 7d f8 01 00 00 00  cmpl   $1, -8(%rbp)
   0x100000efd:  0f 8e 16 00 00 00     jle    0x100000f19               ; main + 57
   0x100000f03:  48 8d 3d 4c 00 00 00  leaq   76(%rip), %rdi            ; "got an arg\n"
   0x100000f0a:  b0 00                 movb   $0, %al
   0x100000f0c:  e8 23 00 00 00        callq  0x100000f34               ; symbol stub for: printf
   0x100000f11:  89 45 ec              movl   %eax, -20(%rbp)
   0x100000f14:  e9 11 00 00 00        jmpq   0x100000f2a               ; main + 74
   0x100000f19:  48 8d 3d 42 00 00 00  leaq   66(%rip), %rdi            ; "no args\n"
   0x100000f20:  b0 00                 movb   $0, %al
   0x100000f22:  e8 0d 00 00 00        callq  0x100000f34               ; symbol stub for: printf

```

As expected, we load a value, compare it to 1 with `cmpl   $1, -8(%rbp)`, and then print `got an arg` or `no args` depending on which way we jump as a result of the compare.

```
$ ./wat-arg
no args
$ ./wat-arg 1
got an arg

```

If we open up a hex editor and change `81 7d f8 01 00 00 00; cmpl   1, -8(%rbp)` to `81 7d f8 06 00 00 00; cmpl   6, -8(%rbp)`, that should cause the program to check for 6 args instead of 1

![Replace cmpl with cmpl 6](https://danluu.com/images/edit-binary/edit-binary.png)

```
$ ./wat-arg
no args
$ ./wat-arg 1
no args
$ ./wat-arg 1 2
no args
$ ./wat-arg 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
got an arg

```

Simple! If you do this a bit more, you'll soon get in the habit of patching in `90` [3](#fn:1) to overwrite things with NOPs. For example, if we replace `0f 8e 16 00 00 00; jle` and `e9 11 00 00 00; jmpq` with `90`, we get the following:

```
   0x100000ee1:  48 89 e5              movq   %rsp, %rbp
   0x100000ee4:  48 83 ec 20           subq   $32, %rsp
   0x100000ee8:  c7 45 fc 00 00 00 00  movl   $0, -4(%rbp)
   0x100000eef:  89 7d f8              movl   %edi, -8(%rbp)
   0x100000ef2:  48 89 75 f0           movq   %rsi, -16(%rbp)
   0x100000ef6:  81 7d f8 01 00 00 00  cmpl   $1, -8(%rbp)
   0x100000efd:  90                    nop
   0x100000efe:  90                    nop
   0x100000eff:  90                    nop
   0x100000f00:  90                    nop
   0x100000f01:  90                    nop
   0x100000f02:  90                    nop
   0x100000f03:  48 8d 3d 4c 00 00 00  leaq   76(%rip), %rdi            ; "got an arg\n"
   0x100000f0a:  b0 00                 movb   $0, %al
   0x100000f0c:  e8 23 00 00 00        callq  0x100000f34               ; symbol stub for: printf
   0x100000f11:  89 45 ec              movl   %eax, -20(%rbp)
   0x100000f14:  90                    nop
   0x100000f15:  90                    nop
   0x100000f16:  90                    nop
   0x100000f17:  90                    nop
   0x100000f18:  90                    nop
   0x100000f19:  48 8d 3d 42 00 00 00  leaq   66(%rip), %rdi            ; "no args\n"
   0x100000f20:  b0 00                 movb   $0, %al
   0x100000f22:  e8 0d 00 00 00        callq  0x100000f34               ; symbol stub for: printf

```

Note that since we replaced a couple of multi-byte instructions with single byte instructions, the program now has more total instructions.

```
$ ./wat-arg
got an arg
no args

```

Other common tricks include patching in `cc` to redirect to an interrupt handler, `db` to cause a debug breakpoint, knowing which bit to change to flip the polarity of a compare or jump, etc. These things are all detailed in the [Intel architecture manuals](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html), but the easiest way to learn these is to develop the muscle memory for them one at a time.

Have fun!

1. I don't actually recommend doing this in an emergency if you haven't done it before. Pushing out a known broken binary that leaks details from future releases is bad, but pushing out an update that breaks your updater is worse. You'll want, at a minimum, a few people who create binary patches in their sleep to code review the change to make sure it looks good, even after running it on a test client.

Another solution, not quite as "good", but much less dangerous, would have been to disable the update server until the new release was ready.

2. If you don't have $1000 to spare, [r2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) is a nice, free, tool with IDA-like functionality.
