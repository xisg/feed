Subject:Re: PostgreSQL's handling of fsync() errors is unsafe and risks data loss at least on XFS
Date:2018-03-28 02:23:46

```

Hi all

Some time ago I ran into an issue where a user encountered data corruption
after a storage error. PostgreSQL played a part in that corruption by
allowing checkpoint what should've been a fatal error.

TL;DR: Pg should PANIC on fsync() EIO return. Retrying fsync() is not OK at
least on Linux. When fsync() returns success it means "all writes since the
last fsync have hit disk" but we assume it means "all writes since the last
SUCCESSFUL fsync have hit disk".

Pg wrote some blocks, which went to OS dirty buffers for writeback.
Writeback failed due to an underlying storage error. The block I/O layer
and XFS marked the writeback page as failed (AS\_EIO), but had no way to
tell the app about the failure. When Pg called fsync() on the FD during the
next checkpoint, fsync() returned EIO because of the flagged page, to tell
Pg that a previous async write failed. Pg treated the checkpoint as failed
and didn't advance the redo start position in the control file.

All good so far.

But then we retried the checkpoint, which retried the fsync(). The retry
succeeded, because the prior fsync() _cleared the AS\_EIO bad page flag_.

The write never made it to disk, but we completed the checkpoint, and
merrily carried on our way. Whoops, data loss.

The clear-error-and-continue behaviour of fsync is not documented as far as
I can tell. Nor is fsync() returning EIO unless you have a very new linux
man-pages with the patch I wrote to add it. But from what I can see in the
POSIX standard we are not given any guarantees about what happens on
fsync() failure at all, so we're probably wrong to assume that retrying
fsync( ) is safe.

If the server had been using ext3 or ext4 with errors=remount-ro, the
problem wouldn't have occurred because the first I/O error would've
remounted the FS and stopped Pg from continuing. But XFS doesn't have that
option. There may be other situations where this can occur too, involving
LVM and/or multipath, but I haven't comprehensively dug out the details yet.

It proved possible to recover the system by faking up a backup label from
before the first incorrectly-successful checkpoint, forcing redo to repeat
and write the lost blocks. But ... what a mess.

I posted about the underlying fsync issue here some time ago:

[https://stackoverflow.com/q/42434872/398670](https://stackoverflow.com/q/42434872/398670)

but haven't had a chance to follow up about the Pg specifics.

I've been looking at the problem on and off and haven't come up with a good
answer. I think we should just PANIC and let redo sort it out by repeating
the failed write when it repeats work since the last checkpoint.

The API offered by async buffered writes and fsync offers us no way to find
out which page failed, so we can't just selectively redo that write. I
think we do know the relfilenode associated with the fd that failed to
fsync, but not much more. So the alternative seems to be some sort of
potentially complex online-redo scheme where we replay WAL only the
relation on which we had the fsync() error, while otherwise servicing
queries normally. That's likely to be extremely error-prone and hard to
test, and it's trying to solve a case where on other filesystems the whole
DB would grind to a halt anyway.

I looked into whether we can solve it with use of the AIO API instead, but
the mess is even worse there - from what I can tell you can't even reliably
guarantee fsync at all on all Linux kernel versions.

We already PANIC on fsync() failure for WAL segments. We just need to do
the same for data forks at least for EIO. This isn't as bad as it seems
because AFAICS fsync only returns EIO in cases where we should be stopping
the world anyway, and many FSes will do that for us.

There are rather a lot of pg\_fsync() callers. While we could handle this
case-by-case for each one, I'm tempted to just make pg\_fsync() itself
intercept EIO and PANIC. Thoughts?

If that's actually the case, we need to push back on this kernel brain
damage, because as you're describing it fsync would be completely useless.

Moreover, POSIX is entirely clear that successful fsync means all
preceding writes for the file have been completed, full stop, doesn't
matter when they were issued.

Any callers of pg\_fsync in the backend code are careful enough to check
the returned status, sometimes doing retries like in mdsync, so what is
proposed here would be a regression.

Craig, is the phenomenon you described the same as the second issue
"Reporting writeback errors" discussed in this article?

[https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/](https://lwn.net/Articles/724307/)

"Current kernels might report a writeback error on an fsync() call,
but there are a number of ways in which that can fail to happen."

That's... I'm speechless.

The retries are the source of the problem ; the first fsync() can return EIO,
and also _clears the error_ causing a 2nd fsync (of the same data) to return
success.

(Note, I can see that it might be useful to PANIC on EIO but retry for ENOSPC).

Worse, the article acknowledges the behavior without apparently suggesting to
change it:

"Storing that value in the file structure has an important benefit: it makes
it possible to report a writeback error EXACTLY ONCE TO EVERY PROCESS THAT
CALLS FSYNC() .... In current kernels, ONLY THE FIRST CALLER AFTER AN ERROR
OCCURS HAS A CHANCE OF SEEING THAT ERROR INFORMATION."

I believe I reproduced the problem behavior using dmsetup "error" target, see
attached.

strace looks like this:

2: EIO isn't seen initially due to writeback page cache;

9: ENOSPC due to small device

18: original IO error reported by fsync, good

25: the original FD is closed

26: ..and file reopened

27: fsync on file with still-dirty data+EIO returns success BAD

10, 19: I'm not sure why there's dup(2), I guess glibc thinks that perror
should write to a separate FD (?)

Also note, close() ALSO returned success..which you might think exonerates the
2nd fsync(), but I think may itself be problematic, no? In any case, the 2nd
byte certainly never got written to DM error, and the failure status was lost
following fsync().

I get the exact same behavior if I break after one write() loop, such as to
avoid ENOSPC.

What I'm failing to grok here is how that error flag even matters,
whether it's a single bit or a counter as described in that patch. If
write back failed, _the page is still dirty_. So all future calls to
fsync() need to try to try to flush it again, and (presumably) fail
again (unless it happens to succeed this time around).

You'd think so. But it doesn't appear to work that way. You can see
yourself with the error device-mapper destination mapped over part of a
volume.

I wrote a test case here.

[https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode/blob/master/testcases/fsync-error-clear.c](https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode/blob/master/testcases/fsync-error-clear.c)

I don't pretend the kernel behaviour is sane. And it's possible I've made
an error in my analysis. But since I've observed this in the wild, and seen
it in a test case, I strongly suspect that's what I've described is just
what's happening, brain-dead or no.

Presumably the kernel marks the page clean when it dispatches it to the I/O
subsystem and doesn't dirty it again on I/O error? I haven't dug that deep
on the kernel side. See the stackoverflow post for details on what I found
in kernel code analysis.

A variant of it, by the looks.

The problem in our case is that the kernel only tells us about the error
once. It then forgets about it. So yes, that seems like a variant of the
statement:

> but there are a number of ways in which that can fail to happen."

Yeah.

It's a bit nuts.

I was astonished when I saw the behaviour, and that it appears undocumented.

I covered this in my original post.

Yes, we check the return value. But what do we do about it? For fsyncs of
heap files, we ERROR, aborting the checkpoint. We'll retry the checkpoint
later, which will retry the fsync(). **Which will now appear to succeed**
because the kernel forgot that it lost our writes after telling us the
first time. So we do check the error code, which returns success, and we
complete the checkpoint and move on.

But we only retried the fsync, not the writes before the fsync.

So we lost data. Or rather, failed to detect that the kernel did so, so our
checkpoint was bad and could not be completed.

The problem is that we keep retrying checkpoints _without_ repeating the
writes leading up to the checkpoint, and retrying fsync.

I don't pretend the kernel behaviour is sane, but we'd better deal with it
anyway.

No. I'm quite serious. Worse, we quite possibly have to do it for ENOSPC as
well to avoid similar lost-page-write issues.

It's not necessary on ext3/ext4 with errors=remount-ro, but that's only
because the FS stops us dead in our tracks.

I don't pretend it's sane. The kernel behaviour is IMO crazy. If it's going
to lose a write, it should at minimum mark the FD as broken so no further
fsync() or anything else can succeed on the FD, and an app that cares about
durability must repeat the whole set of work since the prior succesful
fsync(). Just reporting it once and forgetting it is madness.

But even if we convince the kernel folks of that, how do other platforms
behave? And how long before these kernels are out of use? We'd better deal
with it, crazy or no.

Please see my StackOverflow post for the kernel-level explanation. Note
also the test case link there. [https://stackoverflow.com/a/42436054/398670](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42436054/398670)

It's not useless, it's just telling us something other than what we think
it means. The promise it seems to give us is that if it reports an error
once, everything _after_ that is useless, so we should throw our toys,
close and reopen everything, and redo from the last known-good state.

Though as Tomas posted below, it provides rather weaker guarantees than I
thought in some other areas too. See that lwn.net article he linked.

I can't find anything that says so to me. Please quote relevant spec.

I'm working from
[http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fsync.html](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fsync.html) which
states that

"The fsync() function shall request that all data for the open file
descriptor named by fildes is to be transferred to the storage device
associated with the file described by fildes. The nature of the transfer is
implementation-defined. The fsync() function shall not return until the
system has completed that action or until an error is detected."

My reading is that POSIX does not specify what happens AFTER an error is
detected. It doesn't say that error has to be persistent and that
subsequent calls must also report the error. It also says:

"If the fsync() function fails, outstanding I/O operations are not
guaranteed to have been completed."

but that doesn't clarify matters much either, because it can be read to
mean that once there's been an error reported for some IO operations
there's no guarantee those operations are ever completed even after a
subsequent fsync returns success.

I'm not seeking to defend what the kernel seems to be doing. Rather, saying
that we might see similar behaviour on other platforms, crazy or not. I
haven't looked past linux yet, though.

I found your discussion with kernel hacker Jeff Layton at
[https://lwn.net/Articles/718734/](https://lwn.net/Articles/718734/) in which he said: "The stackoverflow
writeup seems to want a scheme where pages stay dirty after a
writeback failure so that we can try to fsync them again. Note that
that has never been the case in Linux after hard writeback failures,
AFAIK, so programs should definitely not assume that behavior."

The article above that says the same thing a couple of different ways,
ie that writeback failure leaves you with pages that are neither
written to disk successfully nor marked dirty.

If I'm reading various articles correctly, the situation was even
worse before his errseq\_t stuff landed. That fixed cases of
completely unreported writeback failures due to sharing of PG\_error
for both writeback and read errors with certain filesystems, but it
doesn't address the clean pages problem.

Yeah, I see why you want to PANIC.

FWIW my reading is the same as Tom's. It says "all data for the open
file descriptor" without qualification or special treatment after
errors. Not "some".

I see no reason to think that any other operating system would behave
that way without strong evidence... This is openly acknowledged to be
"a mess" and "a surprise" in the Filesystem Summit article. I am not
really qualified to comment, but from a cursory glance at FreeBSD's
vfs\_bio.c I think it's doing what you'd hope for... see the code near
the comment "Failed write, redirty."

And a bit below in the same comments, to this question about PG: "So,
what are the options at this point? The assumption was that we can
repeat the fsync (which as you point out is not the case), or shut
down the database and perform recovery from WAL", the same Jeff Layton
seems to agree PANIC is the appropriate response:
"Replaying the WAL synchronously sounds like the simplest approach
when you get an error on fsync. These are uncommon occurrences for the
most part, so having to fall back to slow, synchronous error recovery
modes when this occurs is probably what you want to do.".
And right after, he confirms the errseq\_t patches are about always
detecting this, not more:
"The main thing I working on is to better guarantee is that you
actually get an error when this occurs rather than silently corrupting
your data. The circumstances where that can occur require some
corner-cases, but I think we need to make sure that it doesn't occur."

Jeff's comments in the pull request that merged errseq\_t are worth

Indeed, that's exactly how I read it as well (opinion formed
independently before reading your sentence above). The errseq\_t
patches landed in v4.13 by the way, so very recently.

> Yeah, I see why you want to PANIC.

Indeed. Even doing that leaves question marks about all the kernel
versions before v4.13, which at this point is pretty much everything
out there, not even detecting this reliably. This is messy.

Wow. It looks like there may be a separate question of when each
filesystem adopted this new infrastructure?

The pre-errseq\_t problems are beyond our control. There's nothing we
can do about that in userspace (except perhaps abandon OS-buffered IO,
a big project). We just need to be aware that this problem exists in
certain kernel versions and be grateful to Layton for fixing it.

The dropped dirty flag problem is something we can and in my view
should do something about, whatever we might think about that design
choice. As Andrew Gierth pointed out to me in an off-list chat about
this, by the time you've reached this state, both PostgreSQL's buffer
and the kernel's buffer are clean and might be reused for another
block at any time, so your data might be gone from the known universe
\-\- we don't even have the option to rewrite our buffers in general.
Recovery is the only option.

Thank you to Craig for chasing this down and +1 for his proposal, on Linux only.

There may still be a way to reliably detect this on older kernel
versions from userspace, but it will be messy whatsoever. On EIO
errors, the kernel will not restore the dirty page flags, but it
will flip the error flags on the failed pages. One could mmap()
the file in question, obtain the PFNs (via /proc/pid/pagemap)
and enumerate those to match the ones with the error flag switched
on (via /proc/kpageflags). This could serve at least as a detection
mechanism, but one could also further use this info to logically
map the pages that failed IO back to the original file offsets,
and potentially retry IO just for those file ranges that cover
the failed pages. Just an idea, not tested.

That sounds like a huge amount of complexity, with uncertainty as to how
it'll behave kernel-to-kernel, for negligble benefit.

I was exploring the idea of doing selective recovery of one relfilenode,
based on the assumption that we know the filenode related to the fd that
failed to fsync(). We could redo only WAL on that relation. But it fails
the same test: it's too complex for a niche case that shouldn't happen in
the first place, so it'll probably have bugs, or grow bugs in bitrot over
time.

Remember, if you're on ext4 with errors=remount-ro, you get shut down even
harder than a PANIC. So we should just use the big hammer here.

I'll send a patch this week.

That won't fix anything released already, so as per the information
gathered something has to be done anyway. The discussion of this thread
is spreading quite a lot actually.

Handling things at a low-level looks like a better plan for the backend.
Tools like pg\_basebackup and pg\_dump also issue fsync's on the data
created, we should do an equivalent for them, with some exit() calls in
file\_utils.c. As of now failures are logged to stderr but not
considered fatal.

Those interfaces have been around since the kernel 2.6 times and are
rather stable, but I was merely responding to your original post comment
regarding having a way of finding out which page(s) failed. I assume
that indeed there would be no benefit, especially since those errors
are usually not transient (typically they come from hard medium faults),
and although a filesystem could theoretically mask the error by allocating
a different logical block, I am not aware of any implementation that
currently does that.

Fully agree, those cases should be sufficiently rare that a complex
and possibly non-maintainable solution is not really warranted.

I am not entirely sure what you mean here, does Pg really treat write()
errors as fatal? Also, the kind of errors that ext4 detects with this
option is at the superblock level and govern metadata rather than actual
data writes (recall that those are buffered anyway, no actual device IO
has to take place at the time of write()).

It is not likely to be fixed (beyond what has been done already with the
manpage patches and errseq\_t fixes on the reporting level). The issue is,
the kernel needs to deal with hard IO errors at that level somehow, and
since those errors typically persist, re-dirtying the pages would not
really solve the problem (unless some filesystem remaps the request to a
different block, assuming the device is alive). Keeping around dirty
pages that cannot possibly be written out is essentially a memory leak,
as those pages would stay around even after the application has exited.

Apparently I was too optimistic. I had looked only at FreeBSD, which
keeps the page around and dirties it so we can retry, but the other
BSDs apparently don't (FreeBSD changed that in 1999). From what I can
tell from the sources below, we have:

```
Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD: retrying fsync() after EIO lies
FreeBSD, Illumos: retrying fsync() after EIO tells the truth

```

Maybe my drive-by assessment of those kernel routines is wrong and
someone will correct me, but I'm starting to think you might be better
to assume the worst on all systems. Perhaps a GUC that defaults to
panicking, so that users on those rare OSes could turn that off? Even
then I'm not sure if the failure mode will be that great anyway or if
it's worth having two behaviours. Thoughts?

I see little benefit to not just PANICing unconditionally on EIO, really.
It shouldn't happen, and if it does, we want to be pretty conservative and
adopt a data-protective approach.

I'm rather more worried by doing it on ENOSPC. Which looks like it might be
necessary from what I recall finding in my test case + kernel code reading.
I really don't want to respond to a possibly-transient ENOSPC by PANICing
the whole server unnecessarily.

BTW, the support team at 2ndQ is presently working on two separate issues
where ENOSPC resulted in DB corruption, though neither of them involve logs
of lost page writes. I'm planning on taking some time tomorrow to write a
torture tester for Pg's ENOSPC handling and to verify ENOSPC handling in
the test case I linked to in my original StackOverflow post.

If this is just an EIO issue then I see no point doing anything other than
PANICing unconditionally.

If it's a concern for ENOSPC too, we should try harder to fail more nicely
whenever we possibly can.

Throwing away the dirty pages _and_ persisting the error seems a lot
more reasonable. Then provide a fcntl (or whatever) extension that can
clear the error status in the few cases that the application that wants
to gracefully deal with the case.

Why do dirty pages need to be kept around in the case of persistent
errors? I don't think the lack of automatic recovery in that case is
what anybody is complaining about. It's that the error goes away and
there's no reasonable way to separate out such an error from some
potential transient errors.

Given precisely that the dirty pages which cannot been written-out are
practically thrown away, the semantics of fsync() (after the 4.13 fixes)
are essentially correct: the first call indicates that a writeback error
indeed occurred, while subsequent calls have no reason to indicate an error
(assuming no other errors occurred in the meantime).

The error reporting is thus consistent with the intended semantics (which
are sadly not properly documented). Repeated calls to fsync() simply do not
imply that the kernel will retry to writeback the previously-failed pages,
so the application needs to be aware of that. Persisting the error at the
fsync() level would essentially mean moving application policy into the
kernel.

Meh^2.

"no reason" - except that there's absolutely no way to know what state
the data is in. And that your application needs explicit handling of
such failures. And that one FD might be used in a lots of different
parts of the application, that fsyncs in one part of the application
might be an ok failure, and in another not. Requiring explicit actions
to acknowledge "we've thrown away your data for unknown reason" seems
entirely reasonable.

As long as fsync() indicates error on first invocation, the application
is fully aware that between this point of time and the last call to fsync()
data has been lost. Persisting this error any further does not change this
or add any new info - on the contrary it adds confusion as subsequent write()s
and fsync()s on other pages can succeed, but will be reported as failures.

The application will need to deal with that first error irrespective of
subsequent return codes from fsync(). Conceptually every fsync() invocation
demarcates an epoch for which it reports potential errors, so the caller
needs to take responsibility for that particular epoch.

Callers that are not affected by the potential outcome of fsync() and
do not react on errors, have no reason for calling it in the first place
(and thus masking failure from subsequent callers that may indeed care).

fsync() doesn't reflect the status of given pages, however, it reflects
the status of the file descriptor, and as such the file, on which it's
called. This notion that fsync() is actually only responsible for the
changes which were made to a file since the last fsync() call is pure
foolishness. If we were able to pass a list of pages or data ranges to
fsync() for it to verify they're on disk then perhaps things would be
different, but we can't, all we can do is ask to "please flush all the
dirty pages associated with this file descriptor, which represents this
file we opened, to disk, and let us know if you were successful."

Give us a way to ask "are these specific pages written out to persistant
storage?" and we would certainly be happy to use it, and to repeatedly
try to flush out pages which weren't synced to disk due to some
transient error, and to track those cases and make sure that we don't
incorrectly assume that they've been transferred to persistent storage.

We do deal with that error- by realizing that it failed and later
_retrying_ the fsync(), which is when we get back an "all good!
everything with this file descriptor you've opened is sync'd!" and
happily expect that to be truth, when, in reality, it's an unfortunate
lie and there are still pages associated with that file descriptor which
are, in reality, dirty and not sync'd to disk.

Consider two independent programs where the first one writes to a file
and then calls the second one whose job it is to go out and fsync(),
perhaps async from the first, those files. Is the second program
supposed to go write to each page that the first one wrote to, in order
to ensure that all the dirty bits are set so that the fsync() will
actually return if all the dirty pages are written?

Reacting on an error from an fsync() call could, based on how it's
documented and actually implemented in other OS's, mean "run another
fsync() to see if the error has resolved itself." Requiring that to
mean "you have to go dirty all of the pages you previously dirtied to
actually get a subsequent fsync() to do anything" is really just not
reasonable- a given program may have no idea what was written to
previously nor any particular reason to need to know, on the expectation
that the fsync() call will flush any dirty pages, as it's documented to
do.

Indeed fsync() is simply a rather blunt instrument and a narrow legacy
interface but further changing its established semantics (no matter how
unreasonable they may be) is probably not the way to go.

Would using sync\_file\_range() be helpful? Potential errors would only
apply to pages that cover the requested file ranges. There are a few
caveats though:

(a) it still messes with the top-level error reporting so mixing it
with callers that use fsync() and do care about errors will produce
the same issue (clearing the error status).

(b) the error-reporting granularity is coarse (failure reporting applies
to the entire requested range so you still don't know which particular
pages/file sub-ranges failed writeback)

(c) the same "report and forget" semantics apply to repeated invocations
of the sync\_file\_range() call, so again action will need to be taken
upon first error encountered for the particular ranges.

It really turns out that this is not how the fsync() semantics work
though, exactly because the nature of the errors: even if the kernel
retained the dirty bits on the failed pages, retrying persisting them
on the same disk location would simply fail. Instead the kernel opts
for marking those pages clean (since there is no other recovery
strategy), and reporting once to the caller who can potentially deal
with it in some manner. It is sadly a bad and undocumented convention.

I think what you have in mind are the semantics of sync() rather
than fsync(), but as long as an application needs to ensure data
are persisted to storage, it needs to retain those data in its heap
until fsync() is successful instead of discarding them and relying
on the kernel after write(). The pattern should be roughly like:
write() -> fsync() -> free(), rather than write() -> free() -> fsync().
For example, if a partition gets full upon fsync(), then the application
has a chance to persist the data in a different location, while
the kernel cannot possibly make this decision and recover.

I think we are conflating a few issues here: having the OS kernel being
responsible for error recovery (so that subsequent fsync() would fix
the problems) is one. This clearly is a design which most kernels have
not really adopted for reasons outlined above (although having the FS
layer recovering from hard errors transparently is open for discussion
from what it seems \[1\]). Now, there is the issue of granularity of
error reporting: userspace could benefit from a fine-grained indication
of failed pages (or file ranges). Another issue is that of reporting
semantics (report and clear), which is also a design choice made to
avoid having higher-resolution error tracking and the corresponding
memory overheads \[1\].

To quote sync\_file\_range(2):

```
   Warning
       This  system  call  is  extremely  dangerous and should not be used in portable programs.  None of these operations writes out the
       file's metadata.  Therefore, unless the application is strictly performing overwrites of already-instantiated disk  blocks,  there
       are no guarantees that the data will be available after a crash.  There is no user interface to know if a write is purely an over‐
       write.  On filesystems using copy-on-write semantics (e.g., btrfs) an overwrite of existing allocated blocks is impossible.   When
       writing  into  preallocated  space,  many filesystems also require calls into the block allocator, which this system call does not
       sync out to disk.  This system call does not flush disk write caches and thus does not provide any data integrity on systems  with
       volatile disk write caches.

```

Given the lack of metadata safety that seems entirely a no go. We use
sfr(2), but only to force the kernel's hand around writing back earlier
without throwing away cache contents.

That's not guaranteed at all, think NFS.

It's broken behaviour justified post facto with the only rational that
was available, which explains why it's so unconvincing. You could just
say "this ship has sailed, and it's to onerous to change because xxx"
and this'd be a done deal. But claiming this is reasonable behaviour is
ridiculous.

Again, you could just continue to error for this fd and still throw away
the data.

If you open the same file with two fds, and write with one, and fsync
with another that's definitely supposed to work. And sync() isn't a
realistic replacement in any sort of way because it's obviously
systemwide, and thus entirely and completely unsuitable. Nor does it
have any sort of better error reporting behaviour, does it?

They're undocumented and extremely surprising semantics that are arguably a
violation of the POSIX spec for fsync(), or at least a surprising
interpretation of it.

So I don't buy this argument.

_might_ simply fail.

It depends on why the error ocurred.

I originally identified this behaviour on a multipath system. Multipath
defaults to "throw the writes away, nobody really cares anyway" on error.
It seems to figure a higher level will retry, or the application will
receive the error and retry.

(See no\_path\_retry in multipath config. AFAICS the default is insanely
dangerous and only suitable for specialist apps that understand the quirks;
you should use no\_path\_retry=queue).

It could mark the FD.

It's not just undocumented, it's a slightly creative interpretation of the
POSIX spec for fsync.

This is almost exactly what we tell application authors using PostgreSQL:
the data isn't written until you receive a successful commit confirmation,
so you'd better not forget it.

We provide applications with _clear boundaries_ so they can know _exactly_
what was, and was not, written. I guess the argument from the kernel is the
same is true: whatever was written since the last _successful_ fsync is
potentially lost and must be redone.

But the fsync behaviour is utterly undocumented and dubiously standard.

What do other major platforms do here? The post above suggests it's a bit
of a mix of behaviours.

Yep. I looked at AIO in the hopes that, if we used AIO, we'd be able to map
a sync failure back to an individual AIO write.

But it seems AIO just adds more problems and fixes none. Flush behaviour
with AIO from what I can tell is inconsistent version to version and
generally unhelpful. The kernel should really report such sync failures
back to the app on its AIO write mapping, but it seems nothing of the sort
happens.

Even accepting that (I personally go with surprising over violation, as if my vote counted), it is highly unlikely that we will convince every kernel team to declare "What fools we've been!" and push a change... and even if they did, PostgreSQL can look forward to many years of running on kernels with the broken semantics.

I wonder how bad it will be in practice if we PANIC. Craig said "This
isn't as bad as it seems because AFAICS fsync only returns EIO in
cases where we should be stopping the world anyway, and many FSes will
do that for us". It would be nice to get more information on that.

Yeah, it'd be nice to give an administrator the chance to free up some
disk space after ENOSPC is reported, and stay up. Running out of
space really shouldn't take down the database without warning! The
question is whether the data remains in cache and marked dirty, so
that retrying is a safe option (since it's potentially gone from our
own buffers, so if the OS doesn't have it the only place your
committed data can definitely still be found is the WAL... recovery
time). Who can tell us? Do we need a per-filesystem answer? Delayed
allocation is a somewhat filesystem-specific thing, so maybe.
Interestingly, there don't seem to be many operating systems that can
report ENOSPC from fsync(), based on a quick scan through some
documentation:

```
POSIX, AIX, HP-UX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD: no
Illumos/Solaris, Linux, macOS: yes

```

I don't know if macOS really means it or not; it just tells you to see
the errors for read(2) and write(2). By the way, speaking of macOS, I
was curious to see if the common BSD heritage would show here. Yeah,
somewhat. It doesn't appear to keep buffers on writeback error, if
this is the right code [1](though it could be handling it somewhere
else for all I know).

Like other people here, I think this is 100% unreasonable, starting
with "the dirty pages which cannot been written out are practically
thrown away". Who decided that was OK, and on the basis of what
wording in what specification? I think it's always unreasonable to
throw away the user's data. If the writes are going to fail, then let
them keep on failing every time. _That_ wouldn't cause any data loss,
because we'd never be able to checkpoint, and eventually the user
would have to kill the server uncleanly, and that would trigger
recovery.

Also, this really does make it impossible to write reliable programs.
Imagine that, while the server is running, somebody runs a program
which opens a file in the data directory, calls fsync() on it, and
closes it. If the fsync() fails, postgres is now borked and has no
way of being aware of the problem. If we knew, we could PANIC, but
we'll never find out, because the unrelated process ate the error.
This is exactly the sort of ill-considered behavior that makes fcntl()
locking nearly useless.

Even leaving that aside, a PANIC means a prolonged outage on a
prolonged system - it could easily take tens of minutes or longer to
run recovery. So saying "oh, just do that" is not really an answer.
Sure, we can do it, but it's like trying to lose weight by
intentionally eating a tapeworm. Now, it's possible to shorten the
checkpoint\_timeout so that recovery runs faster, but then performance
drops because data has to be fsync()'d more often instead of getting
buffered in the OS cache for the maximum possible time. We could also
dodge this issue in another way: suppose that when we write a page
out, we don't consider it really written until fsync() succeeds. Then
we wouldn't need to PANIC if an fsync() fails; we could just re-write
the page. Unfortunately, this would also be terrible for performance,
for pretty much the same reasons: letting the OS cache absorb lots of
dirty blocks and do write-combining is _necessary_ for good
performance.

I might accept this argument if I accepted that it was OK to decide
that an fsync() failure means you can forget that the write() ever
happened in the first place, but it's hard to imagine an application
that wants that behavior. If the application didn't care about
whether the bytes really got to disk or not, it would not have called
fsync() in the first place. If it does care, reporting the error only
once is never an improvement.

I fear that the conventional wisdom from the Kernel people is now "you
should be using O\_DIRECT for granular control". The LWN article
Thomas linked ( [https://lwn.net/Articles/718734](https://lwn.net/Articles/718734)) cites Ted Ts'o:

"Monakhov asked why a counter was needed; Layton said it was to handle
multiple overlapping writebacks. Effectively, the counter would record
whether a writeback had failed since the file was opened or since the
last fsync(). Ts'o said that should be fine; applications that want
more information should use O\_DIRECT. For most applications, knowledge
that an error occurred somewhere in the file is all that is necessary;
applications that require better granularity already use O\_DIRECT."

If you insist on strict conformance to POSIX, indeed the linux
glibc configuration and associated manpage are probably wrong in
stating that \_POSIX\_SYNCHRONIZED\_IO is supported. The implementation
matches that of the flexibility allowed by not supporting SIO.
There's a long history of brokenness between linux and posix,
and I think there was never an intention of conforming to the
standard.

I believe (as tried to explain earlier) there is a certain assumption
being made that the writer and original owner of data is responsible
for dealing with potential errors in order to avoid data loss (which
should be only of interest to the original writer anyway). It would
be very questionable for the interface to persist the error while
subsequent writes and fsyncs to different offsets may as well go through.
Another process may need to write into the file and fsync, while being
unaware of those newly introduced semantics is now faced with EIO
because some unrelated previous process failed some earlier writes
and did not bother to clear the error for those writes. In a similar
scenario where the second process is aware of the new semantics, it would
naturally go ahead and clear the global error in order to proceed
with its own write()+fsync(), which would essentially amount to the
same problematic semantics you have now.

Fully agree, and the errseq\_t fixes have dealt exactly with the issue
of making sure that the error is reported to all file descriptors that
_happen to be open at the time of error_. But I think one would have a
hard time defending a modification to the kernel where this is further
extended to cover cases where:

process A does write() on some file offset which fails writeback,
fsync() gets EIO and exit()s.

process B does write() on some other offset which succeeds writeback,
but fsync() gets EIO due to (uncleared) failures of earlier process.

This would be a highly user-visible change of semantics from edge-
triggered to level-triggered behavior.

That's the only way to think about fsync() guarantees unless you
are on a kernel that keeps retrying to persist dirty pages. Assuming
such a model, after repeated and unrecoverable hard failures the
process would have to explicitly inform the kernel to drop the dirty
pages. All the process could do at that point is read back to userspace
the dirty/failed pages and attempt to rewrite them at a different place
(which is current possible too). Most applications would not bother
though to inform the kernel and drop the permanently failed pages;
and thus someone eventually would hit the case that a large amount
of failed writeback pages are running his server out of memory,
at which point people will complain that those semantics are completely
unreasonable.

Not sure I understand this case. The application may indeed re-write
a bunch of pages that have failed and proceed with fsync(). The kernel
will deal with combining the writeback of all the re-written pages. But
further the necessity of combining for performance really depends on
the exact storage medium. At the point you start caring about
write-combining, the kernel community will naturally redirect you to
use DIRECT\_IO.

Again, conflating two separate issues, that of buffering and retrying
failed pages and that of error reporting. Yes it would be convenient
for applications not to have to care at all about recovery of failed
write-backs, but at some point they would have to face this issue one
way or another (I am assuming we are always talking about hard failures,
other kinds of failures are probably already being dealt with transparently
at the kernel level).

As for the reporting, it is also unreasonable to effectively signal
and persist an error on a file-wide granularity while it pertains
to subsets of that file and other writes can go through, but I am
repeating myself.

I suppose that if the check-and-clear semantics are problematic for
Pg, one could suggest a kernel patch that opts-in to a level-triggered
reporting of fsync() on a per-descriptor basis, which seems to be
non-intrusive and probably sufficient to cover your expected use-case.

Surely that's exactly what process B would want? If it calls fsync and
gets a success and later finds out that the file is corrupt and didn't
match what was in memory it's not going to be happy.

This seems like an attempt to co-opt fsync for a new and different
purpose for which it's poorly designed. It's not an async error
reporting mechanism for writes. It would be useless as that as any
process could come along and open your file and eat the errors for
writes you performed. An async error reporting mechanism would have to
document which writes it was giving errors for and give you ways to
control that.

The semantics described here are useless for everyone. For a program
needing to know the error status of the writes it executed, it doesn't
know which writes are included in which fsync call. For a program
using fsync for its original intended purpose of guaranteeing that the
all writes are synced to disk it no longer has any guarantee at all.

It was always documented as level-triggered. This edge-triggered
concept is a completely surprise to application writers.

You can't possibly make this assumption. Process B may be reading
and writing to completely disjoint regions from those of process A,
and as such not really caring about earlier failures, only wanting
to ensure its own writes go all the way through. But even if it did
care, the file interfaces make no transactional guarantees. Even
without fsync() there is nothing preventing process B from reading
dirty pages from process A, and based on their content proceed to
to its own business and write/persist new data, while process A
further modifies the not-yet-flushed pages in-memory before flushing.
In this case you'd need explicit synchronization/locking between
the processes anyway, so why would fsync() be an exception?

The errseq\_t fixes deal with that; errors will be reported to any
process that has an open fd, irrespective to who is the actual caller
of the fsync() that may have induced errors. This is anyway required
as the kernel may evict dirty pages on its own by doing writeback and
as such there needs to be a way to report errors on all open fds.

If EIO persists between invocations until explicitly cleared, a process
cannot possibly make any decision as to if it should clear the error
and proceed or some other process will need to leverage that without
coordination, or which writes actually failed for that matter.
We would be back to the case of requiring explicit synchronization
between processes that care about this, in which case the processes
may as well synchronize over calling fsync() in the first place.

Having an opt-in persisting EIO per-fd would practically be a form
of "contract" between "cooperating" processes anyway.

But instead of deconstructing and debating the semantics of the
current mechanism, why not come up with the ideal desired form of
error reporting/tracking granularity etc., and see how this may be
fitted into kernels as a new interface.

Well, we do that. If a txn aborts, all writes in the txn are discarded.

I think that's perfectly reasonable. Though we also promise an all or
nothing effect, we make exceptions even there.

The FS doesn't offer transactional semantics, but the fsync behaviour can
be interpreted kind of similarly.

I don't _agree_ with it, but I don't think it's as wholly unreasonable as
all that. I think leaving it undocumented is absolutely gobsmacking, and
it's dubious at best, but it's not totally insane.

Like we do, where we require an explicit rollback.

But POSIX may pose issues there, it doesn't really define any interface for
that AFAIK. Unless you expect the app to close() and re-open() the file.
Replacing one nonstandard issue with another may not be a win.

Yep. That's what I expected to happen on unrecoverable I/O errors. Because,
y'know, unrecoverable.

I was stunned to learn it's not so. And I'm even more amazed to learn that
ext4's errors=remount-ro apparently doesn't concern its self with mere user
data, and may exhibit the same behaviour - I need to rerun my test case on
it tomorrow.

In the presence of multiple apps interacting on the same file, yes. I think
that's a little bit of a stretch though.

For a single app, you can recover by remembering and redoing all the writes
you did.

Sucks if your app wants to have multiple processes working together on a
file without some kind of journal or WAL, relying on fsync() alone, mind
you. But at least we have WAL.

Hrm. I wonder how this interacts with wal\_level=minimal.

It's also spikier. Users have more issues with latency with short, frequent

Our double-caching is already plenty bad enough anyway, as well.

(Ideally I want to be able to swap buffers between shared\_buffers and the
OS buffer-cache. Almost like a 2nd level of buffer pinning. When we write
out a block, we _transfer_ ownership to the OS. Yeah, I'm dreaming. But
we'd sure need to be able to trust the OS not to just forget the block
then!)

Many RDBMSes do just that. It's hardly behaviour unique to the kernel. They
report an ERROR on a statement in a txn then go on with life, merrily
forgetting that anything was ever wrong.

I agree with PostgreSQL's stance that this is wrong. We require an explicit
rollback (or ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT) to restore the session to a usable
state. This is good.

But we're the odd one out there. Almost everyone else does much like what
fsync() does on Linux, report the error and forget it.

In any case, we're not going to get anyone to backpatch a fix for this into
all kernels, so we're stuck working around it.

I'll do some testing with ENOSPC tomorrow, propose a patch, report back.

I still don't understand what "clear the error" means here. The writes
still haven't been written out. We don't care about tracking errors,
we just care whether all the writes to the file have been flushed to
disk. By "clear the error" you mean throw away the dirty pages and
revert part of the file to some old data? Why would anyone ever want
that?

Because Postgres is portable software that won't be able to use some
Linux-specific interface. And doesn't really need any granular error
reporting system anyways. It just needs to know when all writes have
been synced to disk.

It means that the responsibility of recovering the data is passed
back to the application. The writes may never be able to be written
out. How would a kernel deal with that? Either discard the data
(and have the writer acknowledge) or buffer the data until reboot
and simply risk going OOM. It's not what someone would want, but
rather _need_ to deal with, one way or the other. At least on the
application-level there's a fighting chance for restoring to a
consistent state. The kernel does not have that opportunity.

I don't really follow this argument, Pg is admittedly using non-portable
interfaces (e.g the sync\_file\_range()). While it's nice to avoid platform
specific hacks, expecting that the POSIX semantics will be consistent
across systems is simply a 90's pipe dream. While it would be lovely
to have really consistent interfaces for application writers, this is
simply not going to happen any time soon.

And since those problematic semantics of fsync() appear to be prevalent
in other systems as well that are not likely to be changed, you cannot
rely on preconception that once buffers are handed over to kernel you
have a guarantee that they will be eventually persisted no matter what.
(Why even bother having fsync() in that case? The kernel would eventually
evict and writeback dirty pages anyway. The point of reporting the error
back to the application is to give it a chance to recover - the kernel
could repeat "fsync()" itself internally if this would solve anything).

Well, it does know when _some_ writes have _not_ been synced to disk,
exactly because the responsibility is passed back to the application.
I do realize this puts more burden back to the application, but what
would a viable alternative be? Would you rather have a kernel that
risks periodically going OOM due to this design decision?

Well, then the man page probably shouldn't say CONFORMING TO 4.3BSD,
POSIX.1-2001, which on the first system I tested, it did. Also, the
summary should be changed from the current "fsync, fdatasync -
synchronize a file's in-core state with storage device" by adding ",
possibly by randomly undoing some of the changes you think you made to
the file".

No, that's not questionable at all. fsync() doesn't take any argument
saying which part of the file you care about, so the kernel is
entirely not entitled to assume it knows to which writes a given
fsync() call was intended to apply.

I don't deny that it's possible that somebody could have an
application which is utterly indifferent to the fact that earlier
modifications to a file failed due to I/O errors, but is A-OK with
that as long as later modifications can be flushed to disk, but I
don't think that's a normal thing to want.

Well, in PostgreSQL, we have a background process called the
checkpointer which is the process that normally does all of the
fsync() calls but only a subset of the write() calls. The
checkpointer does not, however, necessarily have every file open all
the time, so these fixes aren't sufficient to make sure that the
checkpointer ever sees an fsync() failure. What you have (or someone
has) basically done here is made an undocumented assumption about
which file descriptors might care about a particular error, but it
just so happens that PostgreSQL has never conformed to that
assumption. You can keep on saying the problem is with our
assumptions, but it doesn't seem like a very good guess to me to
suppose that we're the only program that has ever made them. The
documentation for fsync() gives zero indication that it's
edge-triggered, and so complaining that people wouldn't like it if it
became level-triggered seems like an ex post facto justification for a
poorly-chosen behavior: they probably think (as we did prior to a week
ago) that it already is.

Well, the way PostgreSQL works today, we typically run with say 8GB of
shared\_buffers even if the system memory is, say, 200GB. As pages are
evicted from our relatively small cache to the operating system, we
track which files need to be fsync()'d at checkpoint time, but we
don't hold onto the blocks. Until checkpoint time, the operating
system is left to decide whether it's better to keep caching the dirty
blocks (thus leaving less memory for other things, but possibly
allowing write-combining if the blocks are written again) or whether
it should clean them to make room for other things. This means that
only a small portion of the operating system memory is directly
managed by PostgreSQL, while allowing the effective size of our cache
to balloon to some very large number if the system isn't under heavy
memory pressure.

Now, I hear the DIRECT\_IO thing and I assume we're eventually going to
have to go that way: Linux kernel developers seem to think that "real
men use O\_DIRECT" and so if other forms of I/O don't provide useful
guarantees, well that's our fault for not using O\_DIRECT. That's a
political reason, not a technical reason, but it's a reason all the
same.

Unfortunately, that is going to add a huge amount of complexity,
because if we ran with shared\_buffers set to a large percentage of
system memory, we couldn't allocate large chunks of memory for sorts
and hash tables from the operating system any more. We'd have to
allocate it from our own shared\_buffers because that's basically all
the memory there is and using substantially more might run the system
out entirely. So it's a huge, huge architectural change. And even
once it's done it is in some ways inferior to what we are doing today
\-\- true, it gives us superior control over writeback timing, but it
also makes PostgreSQL play less nicely with other things running on
the same machine, because now PostgreSQL has a dedicated chunk of
whatever size it has, rather than using some portion of the OS buffer
cache that can grow and shrink according to memory needs both of other
parts of PostgreSQL and other applications on the system.

There has been a lot of focus in this thread on the workflow:

```
write() -> blocks remain in kernel memory -> fsync() -> panic?

```

But what happens in this workflow:

```
write() -> kernel syncs blocks to storage -> fsync()

```

Is fsync() going to see a "kernel syncs blocks to storage" failure?

There was already discussion that if the fsync() causes the "syncs
blocks to storage", fsync() will only report the failure once, but will
it see any failure in the second workflow? There is indication that a
failed write to storage reports back an error once and clears the dirty
flag, but do we know it keeps things around long enough to report an
error to a future fsync()?

You would think it does, but I have to ask since our fsync() assumptions
have been wrong for so long.

I believe there were some problems of that nature (with various
twists, based on other concurrent activity and possibly different
fds), and those problems were fixed by the errseq\_t system developed
by Jeff Layton in Linux 4.13. Call that "bug #1".

The second issues is that the pages are marked clean after the error
is reported, so further attempts to fsync() the data (in our case for
a new attempt to checkpoint) will be futile but appear successful.
Call that "bug #2", with the proviso that some people apparently think
it's reasonable behaviour and not a bug. At least there is a
plausible workaround for that: namely the nuclear option proposed by
Craig.

So all our non-cutting-edge Linux systems are vulnerable and there is no
workaround Postgres can implement? Wow.

Uh, are you sure it fixes our use-case? From the email description it
sounded like it only reported fsync errors for every open file
descriptor at the time of the failure, but the checkpoint process might
open the file _after_ the failure and try to fsync a write that happened
_before_ the failure.

I looked into buffered AIO a while ago, by the way, and just ... hell no.
Run, run as fast as you can.

The trouble with direct I/O is that it pushes a _lot_ of work back on
PostgreSQL regarding knowledge of the storage subsystem, I/O scheduling,
etc. It's absurd to have the kernel do this, unless you want it reliable,
in which case you bypass it and drive the hardware directly.

We'd need pools of writer threads to deal with all the blocking I/O. It'd
be such a nightmare. Hey, why bother having a kernel at all, except for
drivers?

I'm not sure of anything. I can see that it's designed to report
errors since the last fsync() of the _file_ (presumably via any fd),
which sounds like the desired behaviour:

But I'm not sure what the lifetime of the passed-in "file" and more
importantly "file->f\_wb\_err" is. Specifically, what happens to it if
no one has the file open at all, between operations? It is reference
counted, see fs/file\_table.c. I don't know enough about it to
comment.

Scratch that. Whenever you open a file descriptor you can't see any
preceding errors at all, because:

```
/* Ensure that we skip any errors that predate opening of the file */
f->f_wb_err = filemap_sample_wb_err(f->f_mapping);

```

[https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/open.c#L752](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/open.c#L752)

Our whole design is based on being able to open, close and reopen
files at will from any process, and in particular to fsync() from a
different process that didn't inherit the fd but instead opened it
later. But it looks like that might be able to eat errors that
occurred during asynchronous writeback (when there was nobody to
report them to), before you opened the file?

If so I'm not sure how that can possibly be considered to be an
implementation of \_POSIX\_SYNCHRONIZED\_IO: "the fsync() function shall
force all currently queued I/O operations associated with the file
indicated by file descriptor fildes to the synchronized I/O completion
state." Note "the file", not "this file descriptor + copies", and
without reference to when you opened it.

It's really inode->i\_mapping->wb\_err's lifetime that I should have
been asking about there, not file->f\_wb\_err, but I see now that that
question is irrelevant due to the above.

Holy hell. So even PANICing on fsync() isn't sufficient, because the kernel
will deliberately hide writeback errors that predate our fsync() call from
us?

I'll see if I can expand my testcase for that. I'm presently dockerizing it
to make it easier for others to use, but that turns out to be a major pain
when using devmapper etc. Docker in privileged mode doesn't seem to play
nice with device-mapper.

Does that mean that the ONLY ways to do reliable I/O are:

- single-process, single-file-descriptor write() then fsync(); on failure,
  retry all work since last successful fsync()
- direct I/O

?

Predates the opening of the file by the process that calls fsync().
Yeah, it sure looks that way based on the above code fragment. Does
anyone know better?

I suppose you could some up with some crazy complicated IPC scheme to
make sure that the checkpointer always has an fd older than any writes
to be flushed, with some fallback strategy for when it can't take any
more fds.

I haven't got any good ideas right now.

> - direct I/O

As a bit of an aside, I gather that when you resize files (think
truncating/extending relation files) you still need to call fsync()
even if you read/write all data with O\_DIRECT, to make it flush the
filesystem meta-data. I have no idea if that could also be affected
by eaten writeback errors.

Done, you can find it in
[https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode/tree/master/testcases/fsync-error-clear](https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode/tree/master/testcases/fsync-error-clear)
now.

Warning, this runs a Docker container in privileged mode on your system,
and it uses devicemapper. Read it before you run it, and while I've tried
to keep it safe, beware that it might eat your system.

For now it tests only xfs and EIO. Other FSs should be easy enough.

I haven't added coverage for multi-processing yet, but given what you found
above, I should. I'll probably just system() a copy of the same proc with
instructions to only fsync(). I'll do that next.

I haven't worked out a reliable way to trigger ENOSPC on fsync() yet, when
mapping without the error hole. It happens sometimes but I don't know why,
it almost always happens on write() instead. I know it can happen on nfs,
but I'm hoping for a saner example than that to test with. ext4 and xfs do
delayed allocation but eager reservation so it shouldn't happen to them.

Uh, just to clarify, what is new here is that it is ignoring any
_errors_ that happened before the open(). It is not ignoring write()'s
that happened but have not been written to storage before the open().

FYI, pg\_test\_fsync has always tested the ability to fsync() writes()
from from other processes:

```
Test if fsync on non-write file descriptor is honored:
(If the times are similar, fsync() can sync data written on a different
descriptor.)
    write, fsync, close                5360.341 ops/sec     187 usecs/op
    write, close, fsync                4785.240 ops/sec     209 usecs/op

```

Those two numbers should be similar. I added this as a check to make
sure the behavior we were relying on was working. I never tested sync
errors though.

I think the fundamental issue is that we always assumed that writes to
the kernel that could not be written to storage would remain in the
kernel until they succeeded, and that fsync() would report their
existence.

I can understand why kernel developers don't want to keep failed sync
buffers in memory, and once they are gone we lose reporting of their
failure. Also, if the kernel is going to not retry the syncs, how long
should it keep reporting the sync failure? To the first fsync that
happens after the failure? How long should it continue to record the
failure? What if no fsync() every happens, which is likely for
non-Postgres workloads? I think once they decided to discard failed
syncs and not retry them, the fsync behavior we are complaining about
was almost required.

Our only option might be to tell administrators to closely watch for
kernel write failure messages, and then restore or failover. :-(

The last time I remember being this surprised about storage was in the
early Postgres years when we learned that just because the BSD file
system uses 8k pages doesn't mean those are atomically written to
storage. We knew the operating system wrote the data in 8k chunks to
storage but:

- the 8k pages are written as separate 512-byte sectors
- the 8k might be contiguous logically on the drive but not physically
- even 512-byte sectors are not written atomically

This is why we added pre-page images are written to WAL, which is what
full\_page\_writes controls.

I believe this is how Oracle views the kernel, so there is precedent for
this approach, though I am not advocating it.

Update. Now supports multiple FSes.

I've tried xfs, jfs, ext3, ext4, even vfat. All behave the same on EIO.
Didn't try zfs-on-linux or other platforms yet.

Still working on getting ENOSPC on fsync() rather than write(). Kernel code
reading suggests this is possible, but all the above FSes reserve space
eagerly on write( ) even if they do delayed allocation of the actual
storage, so it doesn't seem to happen at least in my simple single-process
test.

I'm not overly inclined to complain about a fsync() succeeding after a
write() error. That seems reasonable enough, the kernel told the app at the
time of the failure. What else is it going to do? I don't personally even
object hugely to the current fsync() behaviour if it were, say, DOCUMENTED
and conformant to the relevant standards, though not giving us any sane way
to find out the affected file ranges makes it drastically harder to recover
sensibly.

But what's come out since on this thread, that we cannot even rely on
fsync() giving us an EIO _once_ when it loses our data, because:

- all currently widely deployed kernels can fail to deliver info due to
  recently fixed limitation; and
- the kernel deliberately hides errors from us if they relate to writes
  that occurred before we opened the FD (?)

... that's really troubling. I thought we could at least fix this by
PANICing on EIO, and was mostly worried about ENOSPC. But now it seems we
can't even do that and expect reliability. So how the @#$ are we meant to
do?

It's the error reporting issues around closing and reopening files with
outstanding buffered I/O that's really going to hurt us here. I'll be
expanding my test case to cover that shortly.

Also, just to be clear, this is not in any way confined to xfs and/or lvm
as I originally thought it might be.

Nor is ext3/ext4's errors=remount-ro protective. data\_err=abort doesn't
help either (so what does it do?).

It's possible that this is in some way related to using the device-mapper

As far as I recall data\_err=abort pertains to the jbd2 handling of
potential writeback errors. Jbd2 will inetrnally attempt to drain
the data upon txn commit (and it's even kind enough to restore
the EIO at the address space level, that otherwise would get eaten).

When data\_err=abort is set, then jbd2 forcibly shuts down the
entire journal, with the error being propagated upwards to ext4.
I am not sure at which point this would be manifested to userspace
and how, but in principle any subsequent fs operations would get
some filesystem error due to the journal being down (I would
assume similar to remounting the fs read-only).

Since you are using data=journal, I would indeed expect to see
something more than what you saw in dmesg.

I can have a look later, I plan to also respond to some of the other
interesting issues that you guys raised in the thread.

Ideally until the app tells it not to.

But there's no standard API for that.

The obvious answer seems to be "until the FD is closed". But we just
discussed how Pg relies on being able to open and close files freely. That
may not be as reasonable a thing to do as we thought it was when you
consider error reporting. What's the kernel meant to do? How long should it
remember "I had an error while doing writeback on this file"? Should it
flag the file metadata and remember across reboots? Obviously not, but
where does it stop? Tell the next program that does an fsync() and forget?
How could it associate a dirty buffer on a file with no open FDs with any
particular program at all? And what if the app did a write then closed the
file and went away, never to bother to check the file again, like most apps
do?

Some I/O errors are transient (network issue, etc). Some are recoverable
with some sort of action, like disk space issues, but may take a long time
before an admin steps in. Some are entirely unrecoverable (disk 1 in
striped array is on fire) and there's no possible recovery. Currently we
kind of hope the kernel will deal with figuring out which is which and
retrying. Turns out it doesn't do that so much, and I don't think the
reasons for that are wholly unreasonable. We may have been asking too much.

That does leave us in a pickle when it comes to the checkpointer and
opening/closing FDs. I don't know what the "right" thing for the kernel to
do from our perspective even is here, but the best I can come up with is
actually pretty close to what it does now. Report the fsync() error to the
first process that does an fsync() since the writeback error if one has
occurred, then forget about it. Ideally I'd have liked it to mark all FDs
pointing to the file with a flag to report EIO on next fsync too, but it
turns out that won't even help us due to our opening and closing behaviour,
so we're going to have to take responsibility for handling and
communicating that ourselves, preventing checkpoint completion if any
backend gets an fsync error. Probably by PANICing. Some extra work may be
needed to ensure reliable ordering and stop checkpoints completing if their
fsync() succeeds due to a recent failed fsync() on a normal backend that
hasn't PANICed or where the postmaster hasn't noticed yet.

Ideally the kernel would keep its data for as little time as possible.
With fsync, it doesn't really know which process is interested in
knowing about a write error, it just assumes the caller will know how to
deal with it. Most unfortunate issue is there's no way to get
information about a write error.

Thinking aloud - couldn't/shouldn't a write error also be a file system
event reported by inotify? Admittedly that's only a thing on Linux, but
still.

You would almost need an API that registers _before_ the failure that
you care about sync failures, and that you plan to call fsync() to
gather such information. I am not sure how you would allow more than
the first fsync() to see the failure unless you added _another_ API to
clear the fsync failure, but I don't see the point since the first
fsync() might call that clear function. How many applications are going
to know there is _another_ application that cares about the failure? Not
many.

I assume that is the kernel logs. I am thinking the kernel logs have to
be monitored, but how many administrators do that? The other issue I
think you are pointing out is how is the administrator going to know
this is a Postgres file? I guess any sync error to a device that
contains Postgres has to assume Postgres is corrupted. :-(

* * *

see explicit treatment of retrying, though I'm not entirely sure if
the retry flag is set just for async write-back), and apparently
unlike every other kernel I've tried to grok so far (things descended
from ancestral BSD but not descended from FreeBSD, with macOS/Darwin
apparently in the first category for this purpose).

Here's a new ticket in the NetBSD bug database for this stuff:

[http://gnats.netbsd.org/53152](http://gnats.netbsd.org/53152)

As mentioned in that ticket and by Andres earlier in this thread,
keeping the page dirty isn't the only strategy that would work and may
be problematic in different ways (it tells the truth but floods your
cache with unflushable stuff until eventually you force unmount it and
your buffers are eventually invalidated after ENXIO errors? I don't
know.). I have no qualified opinion on that. I just know that we
need a way for fsync() to tell the truth about all preceding writes or
our checkpoints are busted.

\*We mmap() + msync() in pg\_flush\_data() if you don't have
sync\_file\_range(), and I see now that that is probably not a great
idea on ZFS because you'll finish up double-buffering (or is that
triple-buffering?), flooding your page cache with transient data.
Oops. That is off-topic and not relevant for the checkpoint
correctness topic of this thread through, since pg\_flush\_data() is
advisory only.

See manual for failmode=wait \| continue \| panic. Even "continue"

Summary to date:

It's worse than I thought originally, because:

- Most widely deployed kernels have cases where they don't tell you about losing your writes at all; and
- Information about loss of writes can be masked by closing and re-opening a file

So the checkpointer cannot trust that a successful fsync() means ... a successful fsync().

Also, it's been reported to me off-list that anyone on the system calling
sync(2) or the sync shell command will also generally consume the write
error, causing us not to see it when we fsync(). The same is true
for /proc/sys/vm/drop\_caches. I have not tested these yet.

There's some level of agreement that we should PANIC on fsync() errors, at
least on Linux, but likely everywhere. But we also now know it's
insufficient to be fully protective.

I previously though that errors=remount-ro was a sufficient safeguard. It
isn't. There doesn't seem to be anything that is, for ext3, ext4, btrfs or
xfs.

It's not clear to me yet why data\_err=abort isn't sufficient in
data=ordered or data=writeback mode on ext3 or ext4, needs more digging.
(In my test tools that's:
make FSTYPE=ext4 MKFSOPTS="" MOUNTOPTS="errors=remount-ro,
data\_err=abort,data=journal"
as of the current version d7fe802ec). AFAICS that's because
data\_error=abort only affects data=ordered, not data=journal. If you use
data=ordered, you at least get retries of the same write failing. This post
[https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/10/80](https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/10/80) added the option and has some
explanation, but doesn't explain why it doesn't affect data=journal.

zfs is probably not affected by the issues, per Thomas Munro. I haven't run
my test scripts on it yet because my kernel doesn't have zfs support and
I'm prioritising the multi-process / open-and-close issues.

So far none of the FSes and options I've tried exhibit the behavour I
actually want, which is to make the fs readonly or inaccessible on I/O
error.

ENOSPC doesn't seem to be a concern during normal operation of major file
systems (ext3, ext4, btrfs, xfs) because they reserve space before
returning from write(). But if a buffered write does manage to fail due to
ENOSPC we'll definitely see the same problems. This makes ENOSPC on NFS a
potentially data corrupting condition since NFS doesn't preallocate space
before returning from write().

I think what we really need is a block-layer fix, where an I/O error flips
the block device into read-only mode, as if blockdev --setro had
been used. Though I'd settle for a kernel panic, frankly. I don't think
anybody really wants this, but I'd rather either of those to silent data
loss.

I'm currently tweaking my test to do some close and reopen the file between
each write() and fsync(), and to support running with nfs.

I've also just found the device-mapper "flakey" driver, which looks
fantastic for simulating unreliable I/O with intermittent faults. I've been
using the "error" target in a mapping, which lets me remap some of the
device to always error, but "flakey" looks very handy for actual PostgreSQL
testing.

For the sake of Google, these are errors known to be associated with the
problem:

ext4, and ext3 mounted with ext4 driver:

```
[42084.327345] EXT4-fs warning (device dm-0): ext4_end_bio:323: I/O error
10 writing to inode 12 (offset 0 size 0 starting block 59393)
[42084.327352] Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 59393

```

xfs:

```

jfs: (nil, silence in the kernel logs)

You should also beware of "lost page write" or "lost write" errors.

I just confirmed this with a tweak to the test that

```
records the file position
close()s the fd
sync()s
open(s) the file
lseek()s back to the recorded position

```

This causes the test to completely ignore the I/O error, which is not
reported to it at any time.

Fair enough, really, when you look at it from the kernel's point of view.
What else can it do? Nobody has the file open. It'd have to mark the file
its self as bad somehow. But that's pretty bad for our robustness AFAICS.

If dirty writeback fails between our close() and re-open() I see the same
behaviour as with sync(). To test that I set dirty\_writeback\_centisecs
and dirty\_expire\_centisecs to 1 and added a usleep(3\*100\*1000) between
close() and open(). (It's still plenty slow). So sync() is a convenient way
to simulate something other than our own fsync() writing out the dirty
buffer.

If I omit the sync() then we get the error reported by fsync() once when we
re open() the file and fsync() it, because the buffers weren't written out
yet, so the error wasn't generated until we re-open()ed the file. But I
doubt that'll happen much in practice because dirty writeback will get to
it first so the error will be seen and discarded before we reopen the file
in the checkpointer.

In other words, it looks like _even with a new kernel with the error_
_reporting bug fixes_, if I understand how the backends and checkpointer
interact when it comes to file descriptors, we're unlikely to notice I/O
errors and fail a checkpoint. We may notice I/O errors if a backend does
its own eager writeback for large I/O operations, or if the checkpointer
fsync()s a file before the kernel's dirty writeback gets around to trying
to flush the pages that will fail.

I haven't tested anything with multiple processes / multiple FDs yet, where
we keep one fd open while writing on another.

But at this point I don't see any way to make Pg reliably detect I/O errors
and fail a checkpoint then redo and retry. To even fix this by PANICing
like I proposed originally, we need to know we have to PANIC.

AFAICS it's completely unsafe to write(), close(), open() and fsync() and
expect that the fsync() makes any promises about the write(). Which if I
read Pg's low level storage code right, makes it completely unable to
reliably detect I/O errors.

When put it that way, it sounds fair enough too. How long is the kernel
meant to remember that there was a write error on the file triggered by a
write initiated by some seemingly unrelated process, some unbounded time
ago, on a since-closed file?

But it seems to put Pg on the fast track to O\_DIRECT.

Meanwhile, I've extended my test to run postgres on a deliberately faulty

```

Given your report, now I have to wonder if we even reissued the fsync() at
all this time. 'perf' time. OK, with

```
sudo perf record -e syscalls:sys_enter_fsync,syscalls:sys_exit_fsync -a
sudo perf script

```

I see the failed fync, then the same fd being fsync()d without error on the
next checkpoint, which succeeds.

```
        postgres  9602 [003] 72380.325817: syscalls:sys_enter_fsync: fd:

```

... and Pg continues merrily on its way without realising it lost data:

```
[72379.834872] XFS (dm-0): writeback error on sector 118752
[72380.324707] XFS (dm-0): writeback error on sector 118688

```

In this test I set things up so the checkpointer would see the first
fsync() error. But if I make checkpoints less frequent, the bgwriter
aggressive, and kernel dirty writeback aggressive, it should be possible to
have the failure go completely unobserved too. I'll try that next, because
we've already largely concluded that the solution to the issue above is to
PANIC on fsync() error. But if we don't see the error at all we're in
trouble.

I suppose you only see errors because the file descriptors linger open
in the virtual file descriptor cache, which is a matter of luck
depending on how many relation segment files you touched. One thing
you could try to confirm our understand of the Linux 4.13+ policy
would be to hack PostgreSQL so that it reopens the file descriptor
every time in mdsync(). See attached.

In this case I think it's because the kernel didn't get around to doing the
writeback before the eagerly forced checkpoint fsync()'d it. Or we didn't
even queue it for writeback from our own shared\_buffers until just before
we fsync()'d it. After all, it's a contrived test case that tries to
reproduce the issue rapidly with big writes and frequent checkpoints.

So the checkpointer had the relation open to fsync() it, and it was the
checkpointer's fsync() that did writeback on the dirty page and noticed the
error.

If we the kernel had done the writeback before the checkpointer opened the
relation to fsync() it, we might not have seen the error at all - though as
you note this depends on the file descriptor cache. You can see the
silent-error behaviour in my standalone test case where I confirmed the
post-4.13 behaviour. (I'm on 4.14 here).

I can try to reproduce it with postgres too, but it not only requires
closing and reopening the FDs, it also requires forcing writeback before
opening the fd. To make it occur in a practical timeframe I have to make my
kernel writeback settings insanely aggressive and/or call sync() before
re-open()ing. I don't really think it's worth it, since I've confirmed the
behaviour already with the simpler test in standalone/ in the rest repo. To
try it yourself, clone

[https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode](https://github.com/ringerc/scrapcode)

and in the master branch

```
cd testcases/fsync-error-clear

make REOPEN=reopen standalone-run

So, what can we actually do about this new Linux behaviour?

Idea 1:

- whenever you open a file, either tell the checkpointer so it can
  open it too (and wait for it to tell you that it has done so, because
  it's not safe to write() until then), or send it a copy of the file
  descriptor via IPC (since duplicated file descriptors share the same
  f\_wb\_err)
- if the checkpointer can't take any more file descriptors (how would
  that limit even work in the IPC case?), then it somehow needs to tell
  you that so that you know that you're responsible for fsyncing that
  file yourself, both on close (due to fd cache recycling) and also when
  the checkpointer tells you to

Maybe it could be made to work, but sheesh, that seems horrible. Is
there some simpler idea along these lines that could make sure that
fsync() is only ever called on file descriptors that were opened
before all unflushed writes, or file descriptors cloned from such file
descriptors?

Idea 2:

Give up, complain that this implementation is defective and
unworkable, both on POSIX-compliance grounds and on POLA grounds, and
campaign to get it fixed more fundamentally (actual details left to
the experts, no point in speculating here, but we've seen a few
approaches that work on other operating systems including keeping
buffers dirty and marking the whole filesystem broken/read-only).

Idea 3:

Give up on buffered IO and develop an O\_SYNC \| O\_DIRECT based system ASAP.

Any other ideas?

For a while I considered suggesting an idea which I now think doesn't
work. I thought we could try asking for a new fcntl interface that
spits out wb\_err counter. Call it an opaque error token or something.
Then we could store it in our fsync queue and safely close the file.
Check again before fsync()ing, and if we ever see a different value,
PANIC because it means a writeback error happened while we weren't
looking. Sadly I think it doesn't work because AIUI inodes are not
pinned in kernel memory when no one has the file open and there are no
dirty buffers, so I think the counters could go away and be reset.
Perhaps you could keep inodes pinned by keeping the associated buffers
dirty after an error (like FreeBSD), but if you did that you'd have
solved the problem already and wouldn't really need the wb\_err system
at all. Is there some other idea long these lines that could work?

Pragmatically, that's where we are right now. The best answer in this bad situation is (a) fix the error, then (b) replay from a checkpoint before the error occurred, but it appears we can't even guarantee that a PostgreSQL process will be the one to see the error.

Yeah, I've been cooking over that myself.

More below, but here's an idea #5: decide InnoDB has the right idea, and go
to using a single massive blob file, or a few giant blobs.

We have a storage abstraction that makes this way, way less painful than it
should be.

We can virtualize relfilenodes into storage extents in relatively few big
files. We could use sparse regions to make the addressing more convenient,
but that makes copying and backup painful, so I'd rather not.

Even one file per tablespace for persistent relation heaps, another for
indexes, another for each fork type.

That way we can use something like your #1 (which is what I was also
thinking about then rejecting previously), but reduce the pain by reducing
the FD count drastically so exhausting FDs stops being a problem.

Previously I was leaning toward what you've described here:

... and got stuck on "yuck, that's awful".

I was assuming we'd force early checkpoints if the checkpointer hit its fd
limit, but that's even worse.

We'd need to urgently do away with segmented relations, and partitions
would start to become a hinderance.

Even then it's going to be an unworkable nightmare with heavily partitioned
systems, systems that use schema-sharding, etc. And it'll mean we need to
play with process limits and, often, system wide limits on FDs. I imagine
the performance implications won't be pretty.

This appears to be what SQLite does AFAICS.

[https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html](https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html)

though it has the huge luxury of a single writer, so it's probably only
subject to the original issue not the multiprocess / checkpointer issues we
face.

> Idea 3:

That seems to be what the kernel folks will expect. But that's going to
KILL performance. We'll need writer threads to have any hope of it not
_totally_ sucking, because otherwise simple things like updating a heap
tuple and two related indexes will incur enormous disk latencies.

But I suspect it's the path forward.

Goody.

I think our underlying data syncing concept is fundamentally broken, and
it's not really the kernel's fault.

We assume that we can safely:

```
procA: open()
procA: write()
procA: close()

```

... some long time later, unbounded as far as the kernel is concerned ...

```
procB: open()
procB: fsync()
procB: close()

```

If the kernel does writeback in the middle, how on earth is it supposed to
know we expect to reopen the file and check back later?

Should it just remember "this file had an error" forever, and tell every
caller? In that case how could we recover? We'd need some new API to say
"yeah, ok already, I'm redoing all my work since the last good fsync() so
you can clear the error flag now". Otherwise it'd keep reporting an error
after we did redo to recover, too.

I never really clicked to the fact that we closed relations with pending
buffered writes, left them closed, then reopened them to fsync. That's ....
well, the kernel isn't the only thing doing crazy things here.

Right now I think we're at option (4): If you see anything that smells like
a write error in your kernel logs, hard-kill postgres with -m immediate (do
NOT let it do a shutdown checkpoint). If it did a checkpoint since the
logs, fake up a backup label to force redo to start from the last
checkpoint before the error. Otherwise, it's safe to just let it start up
again and do redo again.

Fun times.

This also means AFAICS that running Pg on NFS is extremely unsafe, you MUST
make sure you don't run out of disk. Because the usual safeguard of space
reservation against ENOSPC in fsync doesn't apply to NFS. (I haven't tested
this with nfsv3 in sync,hard,nointr mode yet, _maybe_ that's safe, but I
doubt it). The same applies to thin-provisioned storage. Just. Don't.

This helps explain various reports of corruption in Docker and various
other tools that use various sorts of thin provisioning. If you hit ENOSPC
in fsync(), bye bye data.

I'm not sure that we can do that now, since it would break the new
"Optimize btree insertions for common case of increasing values"
optimization. (I did mention this before it went in.)

I've asked Pavan to at least add a note to the nbtree README that
explains the high level theory behind the optimization, as part of
post-commit clean-up. I'll ask him to say something about how it might
affect extent-based storage, too.

Before we spiral down into despair and excessive alcohol consumption, this is basically the same situation as a checksum failure or some other kind of uncorrected media-level error. The bad part is that we have to find out from the kernel logs rather than from PostgreSQL directly. But this does not strike me as otherwise significantly different from, say, an infrequently-accessed disk block reporting an uncorrectable error when we finally get around to reading it.

FYI: MySQL has by default one file per table these days. The old
approach with one massive file was a maintenance headache so they change
the default some releases ago.

I don't entirely agree - because it affects ENOSPC, I/O errors on thin
provisioned storage, I/O errors on multipath storage, etc. (I identified
the original issue on a thin provisioned system that ran out of backing
space, mangling PostgreSQL in a way that made no sense at the time).

These are way more likely than bit flips or other storage level corruption,
and things that we previously expected to detect and fail gracefully for.

Huh, thanks for the update.

We should see how they handle reliable flushing and see if they've looked
into it. If they haven't, we should give them a heads-up and if they have,
lets learn from them.

This is definitely bad, and it explains a few otherwise-inexplicable corruption issues we've seen. (And great work tracking it down!) I think it's important not to panic, though; PostgreSQL doesn't have a reputation for horrible data integrity. I'm not sure it makes sense to do a major rearchitecting of the storage layer (especially with pluggable storage coming along) to address this. While the failure modes are more common, the solution (a PITR backup) is one that an installation should have anyway against media failures.

There is no spoon^H^H^H^H^Herror flag. We don't need fsync to keep
track of any errors. We just need fsync to accurately report whether
all the buffers in the file have been written out. When you call fsync
again the kernel needs to initiate i/o on all the dirty buffers and
block until they complete successfully. If they complete successfully
then nobody cares whether they had some failure in the past when i/o
was initiated at some point in the past.

The problem is not that errors aren't been tracked correctly. The
problem is that dirty buffers are being marked clean when they haven't
been written out. They consider dirty filesystem buffers when there's
hardware failure preventing them from being written "a memory leak".

As long as any error means the kernel has discarded writes then
there's no real hope of any reliable operation through that interface.

Going to DIRECTIO is basically recognizing this. That the kernel
filesystem buffer provides no reliable interface so we need to
reimplement it ourselves in user space.

It's rather disheartening. Aside from having to do all that work we
have the added barrier that we don't have as much information about
the hardware as the kernel has. We don't know where raid stripes begin
and end, how big the memory controller buffers are or how to tell when
they're full or empty or how to flush them. etc etc. We also don't
know what else is going on on the machine.

That's not an irrational position. File system buffers are _not_ dedicated memory for file system caching; they're being used for that because no one has a better use for them at that moment. If an inability to flush them to disk meant that they suddenly became pinned memory, a large copy operation to a yanked USB drive could result in the system having no more allocatable memory. I guess in theory that they could swap them, but swapping out a file system buffer in hopes that sometime in the future it could be properly written doesn't seem very architecturally sound to me.

Instead, fsync() reports when some of the buffers have not been
written out, due to reasons outlined before. As such it may make
some sense to maintain some tracking regarding errors even after
marking failed dirty pages as clean (in fact it has been proposed,
but this introduces memory overhead).

The question is, what should the kernel and application do in cases
where this is simply not possible (according to freebsd that keeps
dirty pages around after failure, for example, -EIO from the block
layer is a contract for unrecoverable errors so it is pointless to
keep them dirty). You'd need a specialized interface to clear-out
the errors (and drop the dirty pages), or potentially just remount
the filesystem.

This does not necessarily follow. Whether the kernel discards writes
or not would not really help (see above). It is more a matter of
proper "reporting contract" between userspace and kernel, and tracking
would be a way for facilitating this vs. having a more complex userspace
scheme (as described by others in this thread) where synchronization
for fsync() is required in a multi-process application.

I think the big problem is that we don't have any way of stopping
Postgres at the time the kernel reports the errors to the kernel log, so
we are then returning potentially incorrect results and committing
transactions that might be wrong or lost. If we could stop Postgres
when such errors happen, at least the administrator could fix the
problem of fail-over to a standby.

An crazy idea would be to have a daemon that checks the logs and stops
Postgres when it seems something wrong.

Yeah, it's bad. In the short term, the best advice to installations is to monitor their kernel logs for errors (which very few do right now), and make sure they have a backup strategy which can encompass restoring from an error like this. Even Craig's smart fix of patching the backup label to recover from a previous checkpoint doesn't do much good if we don't have WAL records back that far (or one of the required WAL records also took a hit).

In the longer term... O\_DIRECT seems like the most plausible way out of this, but that might be popular with people running on file systems or OSes that don't have this issue. (Setting aside the daunting prospect of implementing that.)

I think the danger presented here is far smaller than some of the
statements in this thread might make one think. In all likelihood, once
you've got an IO error that kernel level retries don't fix, your
database is screwed. Whether fsync reports that or not is really
somewhat besides the point. We don't panic that way when getting IO
errors during reads either, and they're more likely to be persistent
than errors during writes (because remapping on storage layer can fix
issues, but not during reads).

There's a lot of not so great things here, but I don't think there's any
need to panic.

We should fix things so that reported errors are treated with crash
recovery, and for the rest I think there's very fair arguments to be
made that that's far outside postgres's remit.

I think there's pretty good reasons to go to direct IO where supported,
but error handling doesn't strike me as a particularly good reason for
the move.

There is a distinction to be drawn there, though, because we immediately pass an error back to the client on a read, but a write problem in this situation can be masked for an extended period of time.

That being said...

No reason to panic, yes. We can assume that if this was a very big persistent problem, it would be much more widely reported. It would, however, be good to find a way to get the error surfaced back up to the client in a way that is not just monitoring the kernel logs.

Yep.

Another example is a write to an NFS or iSCSI volume that goes away
forever. What if the app keeps write()ing in the hopes it'll come back, and
by the time the kernel starts reporting EIO for write(), it's already
saddled with a huge volume of dirty writeback buffers it can't get rid of
because someone, one day, might want to know about them?

You could make the argument that it's OK to forget if the entire file
system goes away. But actually, why is that ok? What if it's remounted
again? That'd be really bad too, for someone expecting write reliability.

You can coarsen from dirty buffer tracking to marking the FD(s) bad, but
what if there's no FD to mark because the file isn't open at the moment?

You can mark the inode cache entry and pin it, I guess. But what if your
app triggered I/O errors over vast numbers of small files? Again, the
kernel's left holding the ball.

It doesn't know if/when an app will return to check. It doesn't know how
long to remember the failure for. It doesn't know when all interested
clients have been informed and it can treat the fault as cleared/repaired,
either, so it'd have to _keep on reporting EIO for PostgreSQL's own writes_
_and fsyncs() indefinitely_, even once we do recovery.

The only way it could avoid that would be to keep the dirty writeback pages
around and flagged bad, then clear the flag when a new write() replaces the
same file range. I can't imagine that being practical.

Blaming the kernel for this sure is the easy way out.

But IMO we cannot rationally expect the kernel to remember error state
forever for us, then forget it when we expect, all without actually telling
it anything about our activities or even that we still exist and are still
interested in the files/writes. We've closed the files and gone away.

Whatever we do, it's likely going to have to involve not doing that anymore.

Even if we can somehow convince the kernel folks to add a new interface for
us that reports I/O errors to some listener, like an
inotify/fnotify/dnotify/whatever-it-is-today-notify extension reporting
errors in buffered async writes, we won't be able to rely on having it for
5-10 years, and only on Linux.

Right.

Specifically, we need a way to ask the kernel at checkpoint time "was
everything written to \[this set of files\] flushed successfully since the
last time I asked, no matter who did the writing and no matter how the
writes were flushed?"

If the result is "no" we PANIC and redo. If the hardware/volume is screwed,
the user can fail over to a standby, do PITR, etc.

But we don't have any way to ask that reliably at present.

Only if you're "lucky" enough that your clients actually read that data,
and then you're somehow able to figure out across the whole stack that
these 0.001% of transactions that fail are due to IO errors. Or you also
need to do log analysis.

If you want to solve things like that you need regular reads of all your
data, including verifications etc.

Clearly it's not happening a huge amount or we'd have a lot of noise about
Pg eating people's data, people shouting about how unreliable it is, etc.
We don't. So it's not some earth shattering imminent threat to everyone's
data. It's gone unnoticed, or the root cause unidentified, for a long time.

I suspect we've written off a fair few issues in the past as "it'd bad
hardware" when actually, the hardware fault was the trigger for a Pg/kernel
interaction bug. And blamed containers for things that weren't really the
container's fault. But even so, if it were happening tons, we'd hear more
noise.

I've already been very surprised there when I learned that PostgreSQL
completely ignores wholly absent relfilenodes. Specifically, if you
unlink() a relation's backing relfilenode while Pg is down and that file
has writes pending in the WAL. We merrily re-create it with uninitalized
pages and go on our way. As Andres pointed out in an offlist discussion,
redo isn't a consistency check, and it's not obliged to fail in such cases.
We can say "well, don't do that then" and define away file losses from FS
corruption etc as not our problem, the lower levels we expect to take care
of this have failed.

We have to look at what checkpoints are and are not supposed to promise,
and whether this is a problem we just define away as "not our problem, the
lower level failed, we're not obliged to detect this and fail gracefully."

We can choose to say that checkpoints are required to guarantee crash/power
loss safety ONLY and do not attempt to protect against I/O errors of any
sort. In fact, I think we should likely amend the documentation for release
versions to say just that.

> In all likelihood, once

Your database is going to be down or have interrupted service. It's
possible you may have some unreadable data. This could result in localised
damage to one or more relations. That could affect FK relationships,
indexes, all sorts. If you're really unlucky you might lose something
critical like pg\_clog/ contents.

But in general your DB should be repairable/recoverable even in those cases.

And in many failure modes there's no reason to expect any data loss at all,
like:

- Local disk fills up (seems to be safe already due to space reservation at write() time)
- Thin-provisioned storage backing local volume iSCSI or paravirt block device fills up
- NFS volume fills up
- Multipath I/O error
- Interruption of connectivity to network block device
- Disk develops localized bad sector where we haven't previously written data

Except for the ENOSPC on NFS, all the rest of the cases can be handled by
expecting the kernel to retry forever and not return until the block is
written or we reach the heat death of the universe. And NFS, well...

Part of the trouble is that the kernel _won't_ retry forever in all these
cases, and doesn't seem to have a way to ask it to in all cases.

And if the user hasn't configured it for the right behaviour in terms of
I/O error resilience, we don't find out about it.

So it's not the end of the world, but it'd sure be nice to fix.

That's because reads don't make promises about what's committed and synced.
I think that's quite different.

Certainly for current versions.

I think we need to think about a more robust path in future. But it's
certainly not "stop the world" territory.

The docs need an update to indicate that we explicitly disclaim
responsibility for I/O errors on async writes, and that the kernel and I/O
stack must be configured never to give up on buffered writes. If it does,
that's not our problem anymore.

Agreed on that, but I think that's FAR more likely to be things like
multixacts, index structure corruption due to logic bugs etc.

That definitely should be treated separately.

Those should be the same as the above.

I think you're underestimating the complexity of doing that by at least

It is, because all the FSes I looked at reserve space before returning from
write(), even if they do delayed allocation. So they won't fail with ENOSPC
at fsync() time or silently due to lost errors on background writeback.
Otherwise we'd be hearing a LOT more noise about this.

Unfortunately, they aren't.

AFAICS NFS doesn't reserve space with the other end before returning from
write(), even if mounted with the sync option. So we can get ENOSPC lazily
when the buffer writeback fails due to a full backing file system. This
then travels the same paths as EIO: we fsync(), ERROR, retry, appear to
succeed, and carry on with life losing the data. Or we never hear about the
error in the first place.

(There's a proposed extension that'd allow this, see
[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iyer-nfsv4-space-reservation-ops-02#page-5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iyer-nfsv4-space-reservation-ops-02#page-5),
but I see no mention of it in fs/nfs. All the reserve\_space /
xdr\_reserve\_space stuff seems to be related to space in protocol messages
at a quick read.)

Thin provisioned storage could vary a fair bit depending on the
implementation. But the specific failure case I saw, prompting this thread,
was on a volume using the stack:

```
xfs -> lvm2 -> multipath -> ??? -> SAN

```

(the HBA/iSCSI/whatever was not recorded by the looks, but IIRC it was
iSCSI. I'm checking.)

The SAN ran out of space. Due to use of thin provisioning, Linux _thought_
there was plenty of space on the volume; LVM thought it had plenty of
physical extents free and unallocated, XFS thought there was tons of free
space, etc. The space exhaustion manifested as I/O errors on flushes of
writeback buffers.

The logs were like this:

```
kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd] Unhandled sense code
kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd]
kernel: Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE
kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd]
kernel: Sense Key : Data Protect [current]
kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd]
kernel: Add. Sense: Space allocation failed write protect
kernel: sd 2:0:0:1: [sdd] CDB:
kernel: Write(16): **HEX-DATA-CUT-OUT**
kernel: Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 3098338786
kernel: lost page write due to I/O error on dm-0
kernel: Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 3098338787

```

The immediate cause was that Linux's multipath driver didn't seem to
recognise the sense code as retryable, so it gave up and reported it to the
next layer up (LVM). LVM and XFS both seem to think that the lower layer is
responsible for retries, so they toss the write away, and tell any
interested writers if they feel like it, per discussion upthread.

In this case Pg did get the news and reported fsync() errors on
checkpoints, but it only reported an error once per relfilenode. Once it
ran out of failed relfilenodes to cause the checkpoint to ERROR, it
"completed" a "successful" checkpoint and kept on running until the
resulting corruption started to manifest its self and it segfaulted some
time later. As we've now learned, there's no guarantee we'd even get the
news about the I/O errors at all.

WAL was on a separate volume that didn't run out of room immediately, so we
didn't PANIC on WAL write failure and prevent the issue.

In this case if Pg had PANIC'd (and been able to guarantee to get the news
of write failures reliably), there'd have been no corruption and no data
loss despite the underlying storage issue.

If, prior to seeing this, you'd asked me "will my PostgreSQL database be
corrupted if my thin-provisioned volume runs out of space" I'd have said
"Surely not. PostgreSQL won't be corrupted by running out of disk space, it
orders writes carefully and forces flushes so that it will recover
gracefully from write failures."

Except not. I was very surprised.

BTW, it also turns out that the _default_ for multipath is to give up on
errors anyway; see the queue\_if\_no\_path option and no\_path\_retries options.
(Hint: run PostgreSQL with no\_path\_retries=queue). That's a sane default if
you use O\_DIRECT\|O\_SYNC, and otherwise pretty much a data-eating setup.

I regularly see rather a lot of multipath systems, iSCSI systems, SAN
backed systems, etc. I think we need to be pretty clear that we expect them
to retry indefinitely, and if they report an I/O error we cannot reliably
handle it. We need to patch Pg to PANIC on any fsync() failure and document
that Pg won't notice some storage failure modes that might otherwise be
considered nonfatal or transient, so very specific storage configuration
and testing is required. (Not that anyone will do it). Also warn against
running on NFS even with "hard,sync,nointr".

It'd be interesting to have a tool that tested error handling, allowing
people to do iSCSI plug-pull tests, that sort of thing. But as far as I can
tell nobody ever tests their storage stack anyway, so I don't plan on
writing something that'll never get used.

Oh, it's just a minor total rewrite of half Pg, no big deal ;)

I'm sure that no matter how big I think it is, I'm still underestimating it.

The most workable option IMO would be some sort of fnotify/dnotify/whatever
that reports all I/O errors on a volume. Some kind of error reporting
handle we can keep open on a volume level that we can check for each
volume/tablespace after we fsync() everything to see if it all really
worked. If we PANIC if that gives us a bad answer, and PANIC on fsync
errors, we guard against the great majority of these sorts of
should-be-transient-if-the-kernel-didn't-give-up-and-throw-away-our-data
errors.

Even then, good luck getting those events from an NFS volume in which the
backing volume experiences an issue.

And it's kind of moot because AFAICS no such interface exists.

Well firstly that's not necessarily the question. ENOSPC is not an
unrecoverable error. And even unrecoverable errors for a single write
doesn't mean the write will never be able to succeed in the future.
But secondly doesn't such an interface already exist? When the device
is dropped any dirty pages already get dropped with it. What's the
point in dropping them but keeping the failing device?

But just to underline the point. "pointless to keep them dirty" is
exactly backwards from the application's point of view. If the error
writing to persistent media really is unrecoverable then it's all the
more critical that the pages be kept so the data can be copied to some
other device. The last thing user space expects to happen is if the
data can't be written to persistent storage then also immediately
delete it from RAM. (And the _really_ last thing user space expects is
for this to happen and return no error.)

To make things a bit simpler, let us focus on EIO for the moment.
The contract between the block layer and the filesystem layer is
assumed to be that of, when an EIO is propagated up to the fs,
then you may assume that all possibilities for recovering have
been exhausted in lower layers of the stack. Mind you, I am not
claiming that this contract is either documented or necessarily
respected (in fact there have been studies on the error propagation
and handling of the block layer, see \[1\]). Let us assume that
this is the design contract though (which appears to be the case
across a number of open-source kernels), and if not - it's a bug.
In this case, indeed the specific write()s will never be able
to succeed in the future, at least not as long as the BIOs are
allocated to the specific failing LBAs.

I think there are degrees of failure. There are certainly cases
where one may encounter localized unrecoverable medium errors
(specific to certain LBAs) that are non-maskable from the block
layer and below. That does not mean that the device is dropped
at all, so it does make sense to continue all other operations
to all other regions of the device that are functional. In cases
of total device failure, then the filesystem will prevent you
from proceeding anyway.

Right. This implies though that apart from the kernel having
to keep around the dirtied-but-unrecoverable pages for an
unbounded time, that there's further an interface for obtaining
the exact failed pages so that you can read them back. This in
turn means that there needs to be an association between the
fsync() caller and the specific dirtied pages that the caller
intents to drain (for which we'd need an fsync\_range(), among
other things). BTW, currently the failed writebacks are not
dropped from memory, but rather marked clean. They could be
lost though due to memory pressure or due to explicit request
(e.g. proc drop\_caches), unless mlocked.

There is a clear responsibility of the application to keep
its buffers around until a successful fsync(). The kernels
do report the error (albeit with all the complexities of
dealing with the interface), at which point the application
may not assume that the write()s where ever even buffered
in the kernel page cache in the first place.

What you seem to be asking for is the capability of dropping
buffers over the (kernel) fence and idemnifying the application
from any further responsibility, i.e. a hard assurance
that either the kernel will persist the pages or it will
keep them around till the application recovers them
asynchronously, the filesystem is unmounted, or the system
is rebooted.

That seems like a perfectly reasonable position to take, frankly.

The whole _point_ of an Operating System should be that you can do exactly
that. As a developer I should be able to call write() and fsync() and know
that if both calls have succeeded then the result is on disk, no matter
what another application has done in the meantime. If that's a "difficult"
problem then that's the OS's problem, not mine. If the OS doesn't do that,
it's \_not\_doing\_its _job_.

That's what Pg appears to assume now, yes.

Whether that's reasonable is a whole different topic.

I'd like a middle ground where the kernel lets us register our interest and
tells us if it lost something, without us having to keep eight million FDs
open for some long period. "Tell us about anything that happens under
pgdata/" or an inotify-style per-directory-registration option. I'd even
say that's ideal.

In the mean time, I propose that we fsync() on close() before we age FDs
out of the LRU on backends. Yes, that will hurt throughput and cause
stalls, but we don't seem to have many better options. At least it'll only
flush what we actually wrote to the OS buffers not what we may have in
shared\_buffers. If the bgwriter does the same thing, we should be 100% safe
from this problem on 4.13+, and it'd be trivial to make it a GUC much like
the fsync or full\_page\_writes options that people can turn off if they know
the risks / know their storage is safe / don't care.

Some keen person who wants to later could optimise it by adding a fsync
worker thread pool in backends, so we don't block the main thread. Frankly
that might be a nice thing to have in the checkpointer anyway. But it's out
of scope for fixing this in durability terms.

I'm partway through a patch that makes fsync panic on errors now. Once
that's done, the next step will be to force fsync on close() in md and see
how we go with that.

Indeed, as long as you are willing to ignore the consequences of
this design decision: mainly, how you would recover memory when no
application is interested in clearing the error. At which point
other applications with different priorities will find this position
rather unreasonable since there can be no way out of it for them.
Good luck convincing any OS kernel upstream to go with this design.

No OS kernel that I know of provides any promises for atomicity of a
write()+fsync() sequence, unless one is using O\_SYNC. It doesn't
provide you with isolation either, as this is delegated to userspace,
where processes that share a file should coordinate accordingly.

It's not a difficult problem, but rather the kernels provide a common
denominator of possible interfaces and designs that could accommodate
a wider range of potential application scenarios for which the kernel
cannot possibly anticipate requirements. There have been plenty of
experimental works for providing a transactional (ACID) filesystem
interface to applications. On the opposite end, there have been quite
a few commercial databases that completely bypass the kernel storage
stack. But I would assume it is reasonable to figure out something
between those two extremes that can work in a "portable" fashion.

I see what you are saying. So basically you'd always maintain the
notification descriptor open, where the kernel would inject events
related to writeback failures of files under watch (potentially
enriched to contain info regarding the exact failed pages and
the file offset they map to). The kernel wouldn't even have to
maintain per-page bits to trace the errors, since they will be
consumed by the process that reads the events (or discarded,
when the notification fd is closed).

Assuming this would be possible, wouldn't Pg still need to deal
with synchronizing writers and related issues (since this would
be merely a notification mechanism - not prevent any process
from continuing), which I understand would be rather intrusive
for the current Pg multi-process design.

But other than that, similarly this interface could in principle
be similarly implemented in the BSDs via kqueue(), I suppose,
to provide what you need.

Sure, but the question is whether the system can reasonably operate
after some of the writes failed and the data got lost. Because if it
can't, then recovering the memory is rather useless. It might be better
to stop the system in that case, forcing the system administrator to
resolve the issue somehow (fail-over to a replica, perform recovery from
the last checkpoint, ...).

We already have dirty\_bytes and dirty\_background\_bytes, for example. I
don't see why there couldn't be another limit defining how much dirty
data to allow before blocking writes altogether. I'm sure it's not that
simple, but you get the general idea - do not allow using all available
memory because of writeback issues, but don't throw the data away in
case it's just a temporary issue.

> Good luck convincing any OS kernel upstream to go with this design.

Well, there seem to be kernels that seem to do exactly that already. At
least that's how I understand what this thread says about FreeBSD and
Illumos, for example. So it's not an entirely insane design, apparently.

The question is whether the current design makes it any easier for
user-space developers to build reliable systems. We have tried using it,
and unfortunately the answers seems to be "no" and "Use direct I/O and
manage everything on your own!"

We can (and do) take care of the atomicity and isolation. Implementation
of those parts is obviously very application-specific, and we have WAL
and locks for that purpose. I/O on the other hand seems to be a generic
service provided by the OS - at least that's how we saw it until now.

Users ask us about this quite often, actually. The question is usually
about "RAW devices" and performance, but ultimately it boils down to
buffered vs. direct I/O. So far our answer was we rely on kernel to do
this reliably, because they know how to do that correctly and we simply
don't have the manpower to implement it (portable, reliable, handling
different types of storage, ...).

One has to wonder how many applications actually use this correctly,
considering PostgreSQL cares about data durability/consistency so much
and yet we've been misunderstanding how it works for 20+ years.

That doesn't seem like a very practical way. It's better than nothing,
of course, but I wonder how would that work with containers (where I
think you may not have access to the kernel log at all). Also, I'm
pretty sure the messages do change based on kernel version (and possibly
filesystem) so parsing it reliably seems rather difficult. And we
probably don't want to PANIC after I/O error on an unrelated device, so
we'd need to understand which devices are related to PostgreSQL.

Not least because Craig's tests showed that you can't rely on _always_

Right. Write errors are fairly rare, and we've probably ignored a fair
number of cases demonstrating this issue. It kinda reminds me the wisdom
that not seeing planes with bullet holes in the engine does not mean
engines don't need armor \[1\].

Sure, there could be knobs for limiting how much memory such "zombie"
pages may occupy. Not sure how helpful it would be in the long run
since this tends to be highly application-specific, and for something
with a large data footprint one would end up tuning this accordingly
in a system-wide manner. This has the potential to leave other
applications running in the same system with very little memory, in
cases where for example original application crashes and never clears
the error. Apart from that, further interfaces would need to be provided
for actually dealing with the error (again assuming non-transient
issues that may not be fixed transparently and that temporary issues
are taken care of by lower layers of the stack).

It is reasonable, but even FreeBSD has a big fat comment right
there (since 2017), mentioning that there can be no recovery from
EIO at the block layer and this needs to be done differently. No
idea how an application running on top of either FreeBSD or Illumos
would actually recover from this error (and clear it out), other
than remounting the fs in order to force dropping of relevant pages.
It does provide though indeed a persistent error indication that
would allow Pg to simply reliably panic. But again this does not
necessarily play well with other applications that may be using
the filesystem reliably at the same time, and are now faced with
EIO while their own writes succeed to be persisted.

Ideally, you'd want a (potentially persistent) indication of error
localized to a file region (mapping the corresponding failed writeback
pages). NetBSD is already implementing fsync\_ranges(), which could
be a step in the right direction.

I would expect it would be very few, potentially those that have
a very simple process model (e.g. embedded DBs that can abort a
txn on fsync() EIO). I think that durability is a rather complex
cross-layer issue which has been grossly misunderstood similarly
in the past (e.g. see \[1\]). It seems that both the OS and DB
communities greatly benefit from a periodic reality check, and
I see this as an opportunity for strengthening the IO stack in
an end-to-end manner.

Surely this is exactly what the kernel is there to manage. It has to
control how much memory is allowed to be full of dirty buffers in the
first place to ensure that the system won't get memory starved if it
can't clean them fast enough. That isn't even about persistent
hardware errors. Even when the hardware is working perfectly it can
only flush buffers so fast. The whole point of the kernel is to
abstract away shared resources. It's not like user space has any
better view of the situation here. If Postgres implemented all this in
DIRECT\_IO it would have exactly the same problem only with less
visibility into what the rest of the system is doing. If every
application implemented its own buffer cache we would be back in the
same boat only with a fragmented memory allocation.

I still think we're speaking two different languages. There's no
application anywhere that's going to "clear the error". The
application has done the writes and if it's calling fsync it wants to
wait until the filesystem can arrange for the write to be persisted.
If the application could manage without the persistence then it
wouldn't have called fsync.

The only way to "clear out" the error would be by having the writes
succeed. There's no reason to think that wouldn't be possible
sometime. The filesystem could remap blocks or an administrator could
replace degraded raid device components. The only thing Postgres could
do to recover would be create a new file and move the data (reading
from the dirty buffer in memory!) to a new file anyways so we would
"clear the error" by just no longer calling fsync on the old file.

We always read fsync as a simple write barrier. That's what the
documentation promised and it's what Postgres always expected. It
sounds like the kernel implementors looked at it as some kind of
communication channel to communicate status report for specific writes
back to user-space. That's a much more complex problem and would have
entirely different interface. I think this is why we're having so much
difficulty communicating.

Well if they're writing to the same file that had a previous error I
doubt there are many applications that would be happy to consider
their writes "persisted" when the file was corrupt. Ironically the
earlier discussion quoted talked about how applications that wanted
more granular communication would be using O\_DIRECT -- but what we
have is fsync trying to be _too_ granular such that it's impossible to
get any strong guarantees about anything with it.

Honestly I don't think there's _any_ way to use the current interface
to implement reliable operation. Even that embedded database using a
single process and keeping every file open all the time (which means
file descriptor limits limit its scalability) can be having silent
corruption whenever some other process like a backup program comes
along and calls fsync (or even sync?).

Ouch. If a process exits -- say, because the user typed \\q into psql
\-\- then you're talking about potentially calling fsync() on a really
large number of file descriptor flushing many gigabytes of data to
disk. And it may well be that you never actually wrote any data to
any of those file descriptors -- those writes could have come from
other backends. Or you may have written a little bit of data through
those FDs, but there could be lots of other data that you end up
flushing incidentally. Perfectly innocuous things like starting up a
backend, running a few short queries, and then having that backend
exit suddenly turn into something that could have a massive
system-wide performance impact.

Also, if a backend ever manages to exit without running through this
code, or writes any dirty blocks afterward, then this still fails to
fix the problem completely. I guess that's probably avoidable -- we
can put this late in the shutdown sequence and PANIC if it fails.

I have a really tough time believing this is the right way to solve
the problem. We suffered for years because of ext3's desire to flush
the entire page cache whenever any single file was fsync()'d, which
was terrible. Eventually ext4 became the norm, and the problem went
away. Now we're going to deliberately insert logic to do a very
similar kind of terrible thing because the kernel developers have
decided that fsync() doesn't have to do what it says on the tin? I
grant that there doesn't seem to be a better option, but I bet we're
going to have a lot of really unhappy users if we do this.

I don't have a better option but whatever we do, it should be an optional
(GUC) change. We have plenty of YEARS of people not noticing this issue and
Robert's correct, if we go back to an era of things like stalls it is going
to look bad on us no matter how we describe the problem.

For a bit less (or more) crazy idea, I'd imagine creating a Linux kernel
module with kprobe/kretprobe capturing the file passed to fsync or even
byte range within file and corresponding return value shouldn't be that
hard. Kprobe has been a part of Linux kernel for a really long time, and
from first glance it seems like it could be backported to 2.6 too.

Then you could have stable log messages or implement some kind of "fsync
error log notification" via whatever is the most sane way to get this
out of kernel.

If the kernel is new enough and has eBPF support (seems like >=4.4),
using bcc-tools\[1\] should enable you to write a quick script to get
exactly that info via perf events\[2\].

Obviously, that's a stopgap solution ...

I disagree. I have noticed this problem, but blamed it on other things.
For over five years now, I have had to tell customers not to use thin
provisioning, and I have had to add code to postgres to refuse to perform
inserts or updates if the disk volume is more than 80% full. I have lost
count of the number of customers who are running an older version of the
product (because they refuse to upgrade) and come back with complaints that
they ran out of disk and now their database is corrupt. All this time, I
have been blaming this on virtualization and thin provisioning.

What about the bug we fixed in
[https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=2ce439f3379aed857517c8ce207485655000fc8e](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=2ce439f3379aed857517c8ce207485655000fc8e)
? Say somebody does something along the lines of:

```
ps uxww | grep postgres | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

```

...and then restarts postgres. Craig's proposal wouldn't cover this
case, because there was no opportunity to run fsync() after the first
crash, and there's now no way to go back and fsync() any stuff we
didn't fsync() before, because the kernel may have already thrown away
the error state, or may lie to us and tell us everything is fine
(because our new fd wasn't opened early enough). I can't find the
original discussion that led to that commit right now, so I'm not
exactly sure what scenarios we were thinking about. But I think it
would at least be a problem if full\_page\_writes=off or if you had
previously started the server with fsync=off and now wish to switch to
fsync=on after completing a bulk load or similar. Recovery can read a
page, see that it looks OK, and continue, and then a later fsync()
failure can revert that page to an earlier state and now your database
is corrupted -- and there's absolute no way to detect this because
write() gives you the new page contents later, fsync() doesn't feel
obliged to tell you about the error because your fd wasn't opened
early enough, and eventually the write can be discarded and you'll
revert back to the old page version with no errors ever being reported
anywhere.

Another consequence of this behavior that initdb -S is never reliable,
so pg\_rewind's use of it doesn't actually fix the problem it was
intended to solve. It also means that initdb itself isn't crash-safe,
since the data file changes are made by the backend but initdb itself
is doing the fsyncs, and initdb has no way of knowing what files the
backend is going to create and therefore can't -- even theoretically
\-\- open them first.

What's being presented to us as the API contract that we should expect
from buffered I/O is that if you open a file and read() from it, call
fsync(), and get no error, the kernel may nevertheless decide that
some previous write that it never managed to flush can't be flushed,
and then revert the page to the contents it had at some point in the
past. That's mostly or less equivalent to letting a malicious
adversary randomly overwrite database pages plausible-looking but
incorrect contents without notice and hoping you can still build a
reliable system. You can avoid the problem if you can always open an
fd for every file you want to modify before it's written and hold on
to it until after it's fsync'd, but that's pretty hard to guarantee in
the face of kill -9.

I think the simplest technological solution to this problem is to
rewrite the entire backend and all supporting processes to use
O\_DIRECT everywhere. To maintain adequate performance, we'll have to
write a complete I/O scheduling system inside PostgreSQL. Also, since
we'll now have to make shared\_buffers much larger -- since we'll no
longer be benefiting from the OS cache -- we'll need to replace the
use of malloc() with an allocator that pulls from shared\_buffers.
Plus, as noted, we'll need to totally rearchitect several of our
critical frontend tools. Let's freeze all other development for the
next year while we work on that, and put out a notice that Linux is no
longer a supported platform for any existing release. Before we do
that, we might want to check whether fsync() actually writes the data
to disk in a usable way even with O\_DIRECT. If not, we should just
de-support Linux entirely as a hopelessly broken and unsupportable
platform.

Let's lower the pitchforks a bit here. Obviously a grand rewrite is
absurd, as is some of the proposed ways this is all supposed to
work. But I think the case we're discussing is much closer to a near
irresolvable corner case than anything else.

We're talking about the storage layer returning an irresolvable
error. You're hosed even if we report it properly. Yes, it'd be nice if
we could report it reliably. But that doesn't change the fact that what
we're doing is ensuring that data is safely fsynced unless storage
fails, in which case it's not safely fsynced anyway.

Yeah. There's a big difference between not noticing an issue because it
does not happen very often vs. attributing it to something else. If we
had the ability to revisit past data corruption cases, we would probably
discover a fair number of cases caused by this.

The other thing we probably need to acknowledge is that the environment
changes significantly - things like thin provisioning are likely to get
even more common, increasing the incidence of these issues.

Right. We seem to be implicitly assuming that there is a big
difference between a problem in the storage layer that we could in
principle detect, but don't, and any other problem in the storage
layer. I've read articles claiming that technologies like SMART are
not really reliable in a practical sense \[1\], so it seems to me that
there is reason to doubt that this gap is all that big.

That said, I suspect that the problems with running out of disk space
are serious practical problems. I have personally scoffed at stories
involving Postgres databases corruption that gets attributed to
running out of disk space. Looks like I was dead wrong.

That is indeed true (sync would induce fsync on open inodes and clear
the error), and that's a nasty bug that apparently went unnoticed for
a very long time. Hopefully the errseq\_t linux 4.13 fixes deal with at
least this issue, but similar fixes need to be adopted by many other
kernels (all those that mark failed pages as clean).

I honestly do not expect that keeping around the failed pages will
be an acceptable change for most kernels, and as such the recommendation
will probably be to coordinate in userspace for the fsync().

What about having buffered IO with implied fsync() atomicity via O\_SYNC?
This would probably necessitate some helper threads that mask the
latency and present an async interface to the rest of PG, but sounds
less intrusive than going for DIO.

You're kidding, right? We could also just add sleep(30)'s all over the

Why is that required? You could very well just keep per inode information about fatal failures that occurred around. Report errors until that bit is explicitly cleared. Yes, that keeps some memory around until unmount if nobody clears it. But it's orders of magnitude less, and results in usable semantics.

I was going to say that it'd be okay to clear error flag on umount, since any
opened files would prevent unmounting; but, then I realized we need to consider
the case of close()ing all FDs then opening them later..in another process.

I was going to say that's fine for postgres, since it chdir()s into its
basedir, but actually not fine for nondefault tablespaces..

For postgres that'd require backend processes to open() an file such that,

I am assuming you can apply the same principle of selectively using O\_SYNC
at times and places that you'd currently actually call fsync().

Also assuming that you'd want to have a backwards-compatible solution for
all those kernels that don't keep the pages around, irrespective of future
fixes. Short of loading a kernel module and dealing with the problem directly,
the only other available options seem to be either O\_SYNC, O\_DIRECT or ignoring
the issue.

I don't quite see how this is any different from other possible issues
when running multiple applications on the same system. One application
can generate a lot of dirty data, reaching dirty\_bytes and forcing the
other applications on the same host to do synchronous writes.

Of course, you might argue that is a temporary condition - it will
resolve itself once the dirty pages get written to storage. In case of
an I/O issue, it is a permanent impact - it will not resolve itself
unless the I/O problem gets fixed.

Not sure what interfaces would need to be written? Possibly something
that says "drop dirty pages for these files" after the application gets
killed or something. That makes sense, of course.

In my experience when you have a persistent I/O error on a device, it
likely affects all applications using that device. So unmounting the fs
to clear the dirty pages seems like an acceptable solution to me.

I don't see what else the application should do? In a way I'm suggesting
applications don't really want to be responsible for recovering (cleanup
or dirty pages etc.). We're more than happy to hand that over to kernel,
e.g. because each kernel will do that differently. What we however do
want is reliable information about fsync outcome, which we need to
properly manage WAL, checkpoints etc.

Right. What I was getting to is that perhaps the current fsync()

As discussed before, I think this could be acceptable, especially
if you pair it with an opt-in mechanism (only applications that
care to deal with this will have to), and would give it a shot.

Still need a way to deal with all other systems and prior kernel
releases that are eating fsync() writeback errors even over sync().

Isn't the expectation that when a fsync call fails, the next one will
retry writing the pages in the hope that it succeeds?

Of course, it's also possible to do what you suggested, and simply mark
the inode as failed. In which case the next fsync can't possibly retry
the writes (e.g. after freeing some space on thin-provisioned system),
but we'd get reliable failure mode.

I don't think that's as hard as some people argued in this thread. We
could very well open a pipe in postmaster with the write end open in
each subprocess, and the read end open only in checkpointer (and
postmaster, but unused there). Whenever closing a file descriptor that
was dirtied in the current process, send it over the pipe to the
checkpointer. The checkpointer then can receive all those file
descriptors (making sure it's not above the limit, fsync(), close() ing
to make room if necessary). The biggest complication would presumably
be to deduplicate the received filedescriptors for the same file,
without loosing track of any errors.

Even better, we could do so via a dedicated worker. That'd quite
possibly end up as a performance benefit.

I think it'd be fair to open PG\_VERSION of all created
tablespaces. Would require some hangups to signal checkpointer (or
whichever process) to do so when creating one, but it shouldn't be too
hard. Some people would complain because they can't do some nasty hacks
anymore, but it'd also save peoples butts by preventing them from
accidentally unmounting.

Some people expect that, I personally don't think it's a useful
expectation.

We should just deal with this by crash-recovery. The big problem I see
is that you always need to keep an file descriptor open for pretty much
any file written to inside and outside of postgres, to be guaranteed to
see errors. And that'd solve that. Even if retrying would work, I'd
advocate for that (I've done so in the past, and I've written code in pg
that panics on fsync failure...).

What we'd need to do however is to clear that bit during crash
recovery... Which is interesting from a policy perspective. Could be
that other apps wouldn't want that.

I also wonder if we couldn't just somewhere read each relevant mounted
filesystem's errseq value. Whenever checkpointer notices before
finishing a checkpoint that it has changed, do a crash restart.

I was reading this thread up until now as meaning that the standby could
receive corrupt WAL data and become corrupted. That seems a much bigger
problem than merely having the master become corrupted in some unrecoverable
way. It is a long standing expectation that serious hardware problems on
the master can result in the master needing to be replaced. But there has
not been an expectation that the one or more standby servers would be taken
down along with the master, leaving all copies of the database unusable.
If this bug corrupts the standby servers, too, then it is a whole different
class of problem than the one folks have come to expect.

Your comment reads as if this is a problem isolated to whichever server has
the problem, and will not get propagated to other servers. Am I reading
that right?

Can anybody clarify this for non-core-hacker folks following along at home?

Maybe. I'd certainly prefer automated recovery from an temporary I/O
issues (like full disk on thin-provisioning) without the database
crashing and restarting. But I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

And most importantly, it's rather delusional to think the kernel
developers are going to be enthusiastic about that approach ...

Sure. And it's likely way less invasive from kernel perspective.

IMHO it'd be enough if a remount clears it.

Hmmmm, that's an interesting idea, and it's about the only thing that
would help us on older kernels. There's a wb\_err in adress\_space, but
that's at inode level. Not sure if there's something at fs level.

I don't see that as a real problem here. For one the problematic
scenarios shouldn't readily apply, for another WAL is checksummed.

There's the problem that a new basebackup would potentially become
corrupted however. And similarly pg\_rewind.

Note that I'm not saying that we and/or linux shouldn't change
anything. Just that the apocalypse isn't here.

I think that's basically right. There's cases where corruption could get
propagated, but they're not straightforward.

Oh, I agree on that one. But that's more a question of how we force the
kernel's hand on allocating disk space. In most cases the kernel
allocates the disk space immediately, even if delayed allocation is in
effect. For the cases where that's not the case (if there are current
ones, rather than just past bugs), we should be able to make sure that's
not an issue by pre-zeroing the data and/or using fallocate.

That's a good question. I don't see any guarantee it'd be isolated to
the master node. Consider this example:

(0) checkpoint happens on the primary

(1) a page gets modified, a full-page gets written to WAL

(2) the page is written out to page cache

(3) writeback of that page fails (and gets discarded)

(4) we attempt to modify the page again, but we read the stale version

(5) we modify the stale version, writing the change to WAL

The standby will get the full-page, and then a WAL from the stale page
version. That doesn't seem like a story with a happy end, I guess. But I
might be easily missing some protection built into the WAL ...

I can also imagine a master and standby that are similarly provisioned,
and thus hit an out of disk error at around the same time, resulting in
corruption on both, even if not the same corruption. When choosing to
have one standby, or two standbys, or ten standbys, one needs to be able
to assume a certain amount of statistical independence between failures
on one server and failures on another. If they are tightly correlated
dependent variables, then the conclusion that the probability of all
nodes failing simultaneously is vanishingly small becomes invalid.

I think it's a grave mistake conflating ENOSPC issues (which we should
solve by making sure there's always enough space pre-allocated), with
EIO type errors. The problem is different, the solution is different.

In any case, that certainly does not count as data corruption spreading
from the master to standby.

I'm happy to take your word for that.

Maybe not from the point of view of somebody looking at the code. But a
user might see it differently. If the data being loaded into the master
and getting replicated to the standby "causes" both to get corrupt, then
it seems like corruption spreading. I put "causes" in quotes because there
is some argument to be made about "correlation does not prove cause" and so
forth, but it still feels like causation from an arms length perspective.
If there is a pattern of standby servers tending to fail more often right
around the time that the master fails, you'll have a hard time comforting
users, "hey, it's not technically causation." If loading data into the
master causes the master to hit ENOSPC, and replicating that data to the
standby causes the standby to hit ENOSPC, and if the bug abound ENOSPC has
not been fixed, then this looks like corruption spreading.

I'm certainly planning on taking a hard look at the disk allocation on my
standby servers right soon now.

Right. For anyone interested, here is the change you mentioned, and
an interesting one that came a bit earlier last year:

- [https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS316941](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS316941) \-\- drop buffers after device goes away
- [https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS326029](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS326029) \-\- update comment about EIO contract

Retrying may well be futile, but at least future fsync() calls won't
report success bogusly. There may of course be more space-efficient
ways to represent that state as the comment implies, while never lying
to the user -- perhaps involving filesystem level or (pinned) inode
level errors that stop all writes until unmounted. Something tells me
they won't resort to flakey fsync() error reporting.

I wonder if anyone can tell us what Windows, AIX and HPUX do here.

Could there be a risk of a race condition here where fsync incorrectly

Yep. That'd be a cheaper way to do it, though it wouldn't work on
Windows. Though we don't know how Windows behaves here at all yet.

Prior discussion upthread had the checkpointer open()ing a file at the
same time as a backend, before the backend writes to it. But passing
the fd when the backend is done with it would be better.

We'd need a way to dup() the fd and pass it back to a backend when it
needed to reopen it sometimes, or just make sure to keep the oldest
copy of the fd when a backend reopens multiple times, but that's no
biggie.

We'd still have to fsync() out early in the checkpointer if we ran out
of space in our FD list, and initscripts would need to change our
ulimit or we'd have to do it ourselves in the checkpointer. But
neither seems insurmountable.

FWIW, I agree that this is a corner case, but it's getting to be a
pretty big corner with the spread of overcommitted, dedupliating SANs,
cloud storage, etc. Not all I/O errors indicate permanent hardware
faults, disk failures, etc, as I outlined earlier. I'm very curious to
know what AWS EBS's error semantics are, and other cloud network block
stores. (I posted on Amazon forums
[https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=279274&tstart=0](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=279274&tstart=0) but
nothing so far).

I'm also not particularly inclined to trust that all file systems will
always reliably reserve space without having some cases where they'll
fail writeback on space exhaustion.

So we don't need to panic and freak out, but it's worth looking at the
direction the storage world is moving in, and whether this will become
a bigger issue over time.

How would that interlock with concurrent checkpoints?

I can see how to make that work if the share-fd-or-fsync-now logic
happens in smgrwrite() when called by FlushBuffer() while you hold
io\_in\_progress, but not if you defer it to some random time later.

Yes, it can, but not directly through the first error.

What can happen is that we think a block got written when it didn't.

If our in memory state diverges from our on disk state, we can make
subsequent WAL writes based on that wrong information. But that's
actually OK, since the standby will have replayed the original WAL
correctly.

I think the only time we'd run into trouble is if we evict the good
(but not written out) data from s\_b and the fs buffer cache, then
later read in the old version of a block we failed to overwrite. Data
checksums (if enabled) might catch it unless the write left the whole
block stale. In that case we might generate a full page write with the
stale block and propagate that over WAL to the standby.

So I'd say standbys are relatively safe - very safe if the issue is
caught promptly, and less so over time. But AFAICS WAL-based
replication (physical or logical) is not a perfect defense for this.

However, remember, if your storage system is free of any sort of
overprovisioning, is on a non-network file system, and doesn't use
multipath (or sets it up right) this issue _is exceptionally unlikely_
_to affect you_.

Nitpick: In most cases the kernel reserves disk space immediately,
before returning from write(). NFS seems to be the main exception
here.

EXT4 and XFS don't allocate until later, it by performing actual
writes to FS metadata, initializing disk blocks, etc. So we won't
notice errors that are only detectable at actual time of allocation,
like thin provisioning problems, until after write() returns and we
face the same writeback issues.

So I reckon you're safe from space-related issues if you're not on NFS
(and whyyy would you do that?) and not thinly provisioned. I'm sure
there are other corner cases, but I don't see any reason to expect
space-exhaustion-related corruption problems on a sensible FS backed
by a sensible block device. I haven't tested things like quotas,
verified how reliable space reservation is under concurrency, etc as
yet.

How's that not solved by pre zeroing and/or fallocate as I suggested above?

We'd examine the notification queue only once all our checkpoint
fsync()s had succeeded, and before we updated the control file to
advance the redo position.

I'm intrigued by the suggestion upthread of using a kprobe or similar
to achieve this. It's a horrifying unportable hack that'd make kernel
people cry, and I don't know if we have any way to flush buffered
probe data to be sure we really get the news in time, but it's a cool
idea too.

... but _only if they hit an I/O error_ or they're on a FS that
doesn't reserve space and hit ENOSPC.

It still does 99% of the job. It still flushes all buffers to
persistent storage and maintains write ordering. It may not detect and
report failures to the user how we'd expect it to, yes, and that's not
great. But it's hardly throw up our hands and give up territory
either. Also, at least for initdb, we can make initdb fsync() its own
files before close(). Annoying but hardly the end of the world.

Well, I think that there is place for improving reporting of failure
in file\_utils.c for frontends, or at worst have an exit() for any kind
of critical failures equivalent to a PANIC.

Yup.

In the mean time, speaking of PANIC, here's the first cut patch to
make Pg panic on fsync() failures. I need to do some closer review and
testing, but it's presented here for anyone interested.

I intentionally left some failures as ERROR not PANIC, where the
entire operation is done as a unit, and an ERROR will cause us to
retry the whole thing.

For example, when we fsync() a temp file before we move it into place,
there's no point panicing on failure, because we'll discard the temp
file on ERROR and retry the whole thing.

I've verified that it works as expected with some modifications to the
test tool I've been using (pushed).

The main downside is that if we panic in redo, we don't try again. We
throw our toys and shut down. But arguably if we get the same I/O
error again in redo, that's the right thing to do anyway, and quite
likely safer than continuing to ERROR on checkpoints indefinitely.

Patch attached.

To be clear, this patch only deals with the issue of us retrying
fsyncs when it turns out to be unsafe. This does NOT address any of
the issues where we won't find out about writeback errors at all.

Well, I admit that I wasn't entirely serious about that email, but I
wasn't entirely not-serious either. If you can't find reliably find
out whether the contents of the file on disk are the same as the
contents that the kernel is giving you when you call read(), then you
are going to have a heck of a time building a reliable system. If the
kernel developers are determined to insist on these semantics (and,
admittedly, I don't know whether that's the case - I've only read
Anthony's remarks), then I don't really see what we can do except give
up on buffered I/O (or on Linux).

I think that reliable error reporting is more than "nice" -- I think
it's essential. The only argument for the current Linux behavior that
has been so far advanced on this thread, at least as far as I can see,
is that if it kept retrying the buffers forever, it would be pointless
and might run the machine out of memory, so we might as well discard
them. But previous comments have already illustrated that the kernel
is not really up against a wall there -- it could put individual
inodes into a permanent failure state when it discards their dirty
data, as you suggested, or it could do what others have suggested, and
what I think is better, which is to put the whole filesystem into a
permanent failure state that can be cleared by remounting the FS.
That could be done on an as-needed basis -- if the number of dirty
buffers you're holding onto for some filesystem becomes too large, put
the filesystem into infinite-fail mode and discard them all. That
behavior would be pretty easy for administrators to understand and
would resolve the entire problem here provided that no PostgreSQL
processes survived the eventual remount.

I also don't really know what we mean by an "unresolvable" error. If
the drive is beyond all hope, then it doesn't really make sense to
talk about whether the database stored on it is corrupt. In general
we can't be sure that we'll even get an error - e.g. the system could
be idle and the drive could be on fire. Maybe this is the case you
meant by "it'd be nice if we could report it reliably". But at least
in my experience, that's typically not what's going on. You get some
I/O errors and so you remount the filesystem, or reboot, or rebuild
the array, or ... something. And then the errors go away and, at that
point, you want to run recovery and continue using your database. In
this scenario, it matters _quite a bit_ what the error reporting was
like during the period when failures were occurring. In particular,
if the database was allowed to think that it had successfully
checkpointed when it didn't, you're going to start recovery from the
wrong place.

I'm going to shut up now because I'm telling you things that you
obviously already know, but this doesn't sound like a "near
irresolvable corner case". When the storage goes bonkers, either
PostgreSQL and the kernel can interact in such a way that a checkpoint
can succeed without all of the relevant data getting persisted, or
they don't. It sounds like right now they do, and I'm not really
clear that we have a reasonable idea how to fix that. It does not
sound like a PANIC is sufficient.

I think we'd need every child postgres process started by initdb to do
that individually, which I suspect would slow down initdb quite a lot.
Now admittedly for anybody other than a PostgreSQL developer that's
only a minor issue, and our regression tests mostly run with fsync=off
anyway. But I have a strong suspicion that our assumptions about how
fsync() reports errors are baked into an awful lot of parts of the
system, and by the time we get unbaking them I think it's going to be
really surprising if we haven't done real harm to overall system
performance.

BTW, I took a look at the MariaDB source code to see whether they've
got this problem too and it sure looks like they do.
os\_file\_fsync\_posix() retries the fsync in a loop with an 0.2 second
sleep after each retry. It warns after 100 failures and fails an
assertion after 1000 failures. It is hard to understand why they
would have written the code this way unless they expect errors
reported by fsync() to continue being reported until the underlying
condition is corrected. But, it looks like they wouldn't have the
problem that we do with trying to reopen files to fsync() them later
\-\- I spot checked a few places where this code is invoked and in all
of those it looks like the file is already expected to be open.

I think it would be interesting to get in touch with some of the
respective linux kernel maintainers and open up this topic for
more detailed discussions. LSF/MM'18 is upcoming and it would
have been the perfect opportunity but it's past the CFP deadline.
It may still worth contacting the organizers to bring forward
the issue, and see if there is a chance to have someone from
Pg invited for further discussions.

Well Postgres is using the filesystem. The interface between the block
layer and the filesystem may indeed need to be more complex, I
wouldn't know.

But I don't think "all possibilities" is a very useful concept.
Neither layer here is going to be perfect. They can only promise that
all possibilities that have actually been implemented have been
exhausted. And even among those only to the degree they can be done
automatically within the engineering tradeoffs and constraints. There
will always be cases like thin provisioned devices that an operator
can expand, or degraded raid arrays that can be repaired after a long
operation and so on. A network device can't be sure whether a remote
server may eventually come back or not and have to be reconfigured by
a human or system automation tool to point to the new server or new
network configuration.

No, the interface we have is fsync which gives us that information
with the granularity of a single file. The database could in theory
recognize that fsync is not completing on a file and read that file
back and write it to a new file. More likely we would implement a
feature Oracle has of writing key files to multiple devices. But
currently in practice that's not what would happen, what would happen
would be a human would recognize that the database has stopped being
able to commit and there are hardware errors in the log and would stop
the database, take a backup, and restore onto a new working device.
The current interface is that there's one error and then Postgres
would pretty much have to say, "sorry, your database is corrupt and
the data is gone, restore from your backups". Which is pretty dismal.

Postgres cannot just store the entire database in RAM. It writes
things to the filesystem all the time. It calls fsync only when it
needs a write barrier to ensure consistency. That's only frequent on
the transaction log to ensure it's flushed before data modifications
and then periodically to checkpoint the data files. The amount of data
written between checkpoints can be arbitrarily large and Postgres has
no idea how much memory is available as filesystem buffers or how much
i/o bandwidth is available or other memory pressure there is. What
you're suggesting is that the application should have to babysit the
filesystem buffer cache and reimplement all of it in user-space
because the filesystem is free to throw away any data any time it
chooses?

The current interface to throw away filesystem buffer cache is
unmount. It sounds like the kernel would like a more granular way to
discard just part of a device which makes a lot of sense in the age of
large network block devices. But I don't think just saying that the
filesystem buffer cache is now something every application needs to
re-implement in user-space really helps with that, they're going to
have the same problems to solve.

I'm kind of puzzled by this. Surely NFS servers store the data in the
filesystem using write(2) or the in-kernel equivalent? So if the
server is backed by a filesystem where write(2) preallocates space
surely the NFS server must behave as if it'spreallocating as well? I
would expect NFS to provide basically the same set of possible
failures as the underlying filesystem (as long as you don't enable
nosync of course).

-hackers,

I reached out to the Linux ext4 devs, here is tytso(at)mit(dot)edu response:

"""
Hi Joshua,

This isn't actually an ext4 issue, but a long-standing VFS/MM issue.

There are going to be multiple opinions about what the right thing to
do. I'll try to give as unbiased a description as possible, but
certainly some of this is going to be filtered by my own biases no
matter how careful I can be.

First of all, what storage devices will do when they hit an exception
condition is quite non-deterministic. For example, the vast majority
of SSD's are not power fail certified. What this means is that if
they suffer a power drop while they are doing a GC, it is quite
possible for data written six months ago to be lost as a result. The
LBA could potentialy be far, far away from any LBA's that were
recently written, and there could have been multiple CACHE FLUSH
operations in the since the LBA in question was last written six
months ago. No matter; for a consumer-grade SSD, it's possible for
that LBA to be trashed after an unexpected power drop.

Which is why after a while, one can get quite paranoid and assume that
the only way you can guarantee data robustness is to store multiple
copies and/or use erasure encoding, with some of the copies or shards
written to geographically diverse data centers.

Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of the
companies who require data robustness, and are either willing to pay
$$$ to an enterprise distro company like Red Hat, or command a large
enough paying customer base that they can afford to dictate terms to
an enterprise distro, or hire a consultant such as Christoph, or have
their own staffed Linux kernel teams, have tended to use O\_DIRECT. So
for better or for worse, there has not been as much investment in
buffered I/O and data robustness in the face of exception handling of
storage devices.

Next, the reason why fsync() has the behaviour that it does is one
ofhe the most common cases of I/O storage errors in buffered use
cases, certainly as seen by the community distros, is the user who
pulls out USB stick while it is in use. In that case, if there are
dirtied pages in the page cache, the question is what can you do?
Sooner or later the writes will time out, and if you leave the pages
dirty, then it effectively becomes a permanent memory leak. You can't
unmount the file system --- that requires writing out all of the pages
such that the dirty bit is turned off. And if you don't clear the
dirty bit on an I/O error, then they can never be cleaned. You can't
even re-insert the USB stick; the re-inserted USB stick will get a new
block device. Worse, when the USB stick was pulled, it will have
suffered a power drop, and see above about what could happen after a
power drop for non-power fail certified flash devices --- it goes
double for the cheap sh\*t USB sticks found in the checkout aisle of
Micro Center.

So this is the explanation for why Linux handles I/O errors by
clearing the dirty bit after reporting the error up to user space.
And why there is not eagerness to solve the problem simply by "don't
clear the dirty bit". For every one Postgres installation that might
have a better recover after an I/O error, there's probably a thousand
clueless Fedora and Ubuntu users who will have a much worse user
experience after a USB stick pull happens.

I can think of things that could be done --- for example, it could be
switchable on a per-block device basis (or maybe a per-mount basis)
whether or not the dirty bit gets cleared after the error is reported
to userspace. And perhaps there could be a new unmount flag that
causes all dirty pages to be wiped out, which could be used to recover
after a permanent loss of the block device. But the question is who
is going to invest the time to make these changes? If there is a
company who is willing to pay to comission this work, it's almost
certainly soluble. Or if a company which has a kernel on staff is
willing to direct an engineer to work on it, it certainly could be
solved. But again, of the companies who have client code where we
care about robustness and proper handling of failed disk drives, and
which have a kernel team on staff, pretty much all of the ones I can
think of (e.g., Oracle, Google, etc.) use O\_DIRECT and they don't try
to make buffered writes and error reporting via fsync(2) work well.

In general these companies want low-level control over buffer cache
eviction algorithms, which drives them towards the design decision of
effectively implementing the page cache in userspace, and using
O\_DIRECT reads/writes.

If you are aware of a company who is willing to pay to have a new
kernel feature implemented to meet your needs, we might be able to
refer you to a company or a consultant who might be able to do that
work. Let me know off-line if that's the case...

FWIW, it is my current intention to be sure that the development
community is at least aware of the issue by the time LSFMM starts.

The event is April 23-25 in Park City, Utah. I bet that room could be

I always wondered why Linux didn't implement umount -f. It's been in
BSD since forever and it's a major annoyance that it's missing in
Linux. Even without leaking memory it still leaks other resources,
causes confusion and awkward workarounds in UI and automation
software.

If that room can be found, I might be able to make it. Being in SF, I'm
probably the physically closest PG dev involved in the discussion.

I don't think the write is _sent_ to the NFS at the time of the write,
so while the NFS side would reserve the space, it might get the write
request until after we return write success to the process.

My more-considered crazy idea is to have a postgresql.conf setting like
archive\_command that allows the administrator to specify a command that
will be run _after_ fsync but before the checkpoint is marked as
complete. While we can have write flush errors before fsync and never
see the errors during fsync, we will not have write flush errors _after_
fsync that are associated with previous writes.

The script should check for I/O or space-exhaustion errors and return
false in that case, in which case we can stop and maybe stop and crash
recover. We could have an exit of 1 do the former, and an exit of 2 do
the later.

Also, if we are relying on WAL, we have to make sure WAL is actually
safe with fsync, and I am betting only the O\_DIRECT methods actually
are safe:

```
    #wal_sync_method = fsync                # the default is the first option
                                            # supported by the operating system:
                                            #   open_datasync
                                     -->    #   fdatasync (default on Linux)
                                     -->    #   fsync
                                     -->    #   fsync_writethrough
                                            #   open_sync

```

I am betting the marked wal\_sync\_method methods are not safe since there
is time between the write and fsync.

Replying to your specific case, I am not sure how we would use a script
to check for I/O errors/space-exhaustion if the postgres user doesn't
have access to it. Does O\_DIRECT work in such container cases?

Hm? That's not really the issue though? One issue is that retries are
not necessarily safe in buffered IO, the other that fsync might not
report an error if the fd was closed and opened.

O\_DIRECT is only used if wal archiving or streaming isn't used, which
makes it pretty useless anyway.

You can certainly have access to the kernel log in containers. I'd
assume such a script wouldn't check various system logs but instead tail
/dev/kmsg or such. Otherwise the variance between installations would be
too big.

There's not _that_ many different type of error messages and they don't
change that often. If we'd just detect error for the most common FSs
we'd probably be good. Detecting a few general storage layer message
wouldn't be that hard either, most things have been unified over the
last ~8-10 years.

Not sure what you mean?

Space exhaustiion can be checked when allocating space, FWIW. We'd just
need to use posix\_fallocate et al.

Yes, I think we need to look at user expectations here.

If the device has a hardware write error, it is true that it is good to
detect it, and it might be permanent or temporary, e.g. NAS/NFS. The
longer the error persists, the more likely the user will expect
corruption. However, right now, any length outage could cause
corruption, and it will not be reported in all cases.

Running out of disk space is also something you don't expect to corrupt
your database --- you expect it to only prevent future writes. It seems
NAS/NFS and any thin provisioned storage will have this problem, and
again, not always reported.

So, our initial action might just be to educate users that write errors
can cause silent corruption, and out-of-space errors on NAS/NFS and any
thin provisioned storage can cause corruption.

Kernel logs (not just Postgres logs) should be monitored for these
issues and fail-over/recovering might be necessary.

Well, we have have been focusing on the delay between backend or
checkpoint writes and checkpoint fsyncs. My point is that we have the
same problem in doing a write, _then_ fsync for the WAL. Yes, the delay
is much shorter, but the issue still exists. I realize that newer Linux
kernels will not have the problem since the file descriptor remains
open, but the problem exists with older/common linux kernels.

Uh, as doesn't 'open\_datasync' and 'open\_sync' fsync as part of the
write, meaning we can't lose the error report like we can with the
others?

It should be sent if you're using sync mode.

From my reading of the docs, if you're using async mode you're already
open to so many potential corruptions you might as well not bother.

I need to look into this more re NFS and expand the tests I have to
cover that properly.

Thinking about this some more, it'll definitely need a GUC to force it
to continue despite a potential hazard. Otherwise we go backwards from
the status quo if we're in a position where uptime is vital and
correctness problems can be tolerated or repaired later. Kind of like
zero\_damaged\_pages, we'll need some sort of
continue\_after\_fsync\_errors .

Without that, we'll panic once, enter redo, and if the problem
persists we'll panic in redo and exit the startup process. That's not
going to help users.

I'll amend the patch accordingly as time permits.

So, if sync mode passes the write to NFS, and NFS pre-reserves write
space, and throws an error on reservation failure, that means that NFS
will not corrupt a cluster on out-of-space errors.

So, what about thin provisioning? I can understand sharing _free_ space
among file systems, but once a write arrives I assume it reserves the
space. Is the problem that many thin provisioning systems don't have a
sync mode, so you can't force the write to appear on the device before
an fsync?

It is hard to know exactly what the message format should be for each
operating system because it is hard to generate them on demand, and we
would need to filter based on Postgres devices.

The other issue is that once you see a message during a checkpoint and
exit, you don't want to see that message again after the problem has
been fixed and the server restarted. The simplest solution is to save
the output of the last check and look for only new entries. I am
attaching a script I run every 15 minutes from cron that emails me any
unexpected kernel messages.

I am thinking we would need a contrib module with sample scripts for
various operating systems.

I was asking about cases where permissions prevent viewing of kernel
messages. I think you can view them in containers, but in virtual
machines you might not have access to the host operating system's kernel
messages, and that might be where they are.

Yeah. I need to verify in a concrete test case.

The thing is that write() is allowed to be asynchronous anyway. Most
file systems choose to implement eager reservation of space, but it's
not mandated. AFAICS that's largely a historical accident to keep
applications happy, because FSes used to _allocate_ the space at
write() time too, and when they moved to delayed allocations, apps
tended to break too easily unless they at least reserved space. NFS
would have to do a round-trip on write() to reserve space.

The Linux man pages ( [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html)) say:

Most thin provisioning is done at the block level, not file system
level. So the FS is usually unaware it's on a thin-provisioned volume.
Usually the whole kernel is unaware, because the thin provisioning is
done on the SAN end or by a hypervisor. But the same sort of thing may
be done via LVM - see lvmthin. For example, you may make 100 different
1TB ext4 FSes, each on 1TB iSCSI volumes backed by SAN with a total of
50TB of concrete physical capacity. The SAN is doing block mapping and
only allocating storage chunks to a given volume when the FS has
written blocks to every previous free block in the previous storage
chunk. It may also do things like block de-duplication, compression of
storage chunks that aren't written to for a while, etc.

The idea is that when the SAN's actual physically allocate storage
gets to 40TB it starts telling you to go buy another rack of storage
so you don't run out. You don't have to resize volumes, resize file
systems, etc. All the storage space admin is centralized on the SAN
and storage team, and your sysadmins, DBAs and app devs are none the
wiser. You buy storage when you need it, not when the DBA demands they
need a 200% free space margin just in case. Whether or not you agree
with this philosophy or think it's sensible is kind of moot, because
it's an extremely widespread model, and servers you work on may well
be backed by thin provisioned storage _even if you don't know it_.

Think of it as a bit like VM overcommit, for storage. You can malloc()
as much memory as you like and everything's fine until you try to
actually use it. Then you go to dirty a page, no free pages are
available, and _boom_.

The thing is, the SAN (or LVM) doesn't have any idea about the FS's
internal in-memory free space counter and its space reservations. Nor
does it understand any FS metadata. All it cares about is "has this
LBA ever been written to by the FS?". If so, it must make sure backing
storage for it exists. If not, it won't bother.

Most FSes only touch the blocks on dirty writeback, or sometimes
lazily as part of delayed allocation. So if your SAN is running out of
space and there's 100MB free, each of your 100 FSes may have
decremented its freelist by 2MB and be happily promising more space to
apps on write() because, well, as far as they know they're only 50%
full. When they all do dirty writeback and flush to storage, kaboom,
there's nowhere to put some of the data.

I don't know if posix\_fallocate is a sufficient safeguard either.
You'd have to actually force writes to each page through to the
backing storage to know for sure the space existed. Yes, the docs say

> After a
> successful call to posix\_fallocate(), subsequent writes to bytes in

... but they're speaking from the filesystem's perspective. If the FS
doesn't dirty and flush the actual blocks, a thin provisioned storage
system won't know.

It's reasonable enough to throw up our hands in this case and say
"your setup is crazy, you're breaking the rules, don't do that". The
truth is they AREN'T breaking the rules, but we can disclaim support
for such configurations anyway.

After all, we tell people not to use Linux's VM overcommit too. How's
that working for you? I see it enabled on the great majority of
systems I work with, and some people are very reluctant to turn it off
because they don't want to have to add swap.

If someone has a 50TB SAN and wants to allow for unpredictable space
use expansion between various volumes, and we say "you can't do that,
go buy a 100TB SAN instead" ... that's not going to go down too well
either. Often we can actually say "make sure the 5TB volume PostgreSQL
is using is eagerly provisioned, and expand it at need using online
resize if required. We don't care about the rest of the SAN.".

I guarantee you that when you create a 100GB EBS volume on AWS EC2,
you don't get 100GB of storage preallocated. AWS are probably pretty
good about not running out of backing store, though.

There _are_ file systems optimised for thin provisioning, etc, too.
But that's more commonly done by having them do things like zero
deallocated space so the thin provisioning system knows it can return
it to the free pool, and now things like DISCARD provide much of that
signalling in a standard way.

Some db folks (used to anyway) advise dd'ing to your freshly attached

prevent some failure scenarios for any thin provisioned storage (but

This still makes a lot of sense on AWS EBS, particularly when using a
volume created from a non-empty snapshot. Performance of S3-snapshot
based EBS volumes is spectacularly awful, since they're copy-on-read.
Reading the whole volume helps a lot.

Uh, even calling fsync after write isn't 100% safe since the kernel
could have flushed the dirty pages to storage, and failed, and the fsync
would later succeed. I realize newer kernels have that fixed for files
open during that operation, but that is the minority of installs.

I see what you are saying --- that the kernel is reserving the write
space from its free space, but the free space doesn't all exist. I am
not sure how we can tell people to make sure the file system free space
is real.

Frankly, in what cases will a write fail _for_ lack of free space? It
could be a new WAL file (not recycled), or a pages added to the end of
the table.

Is that it? It doesn't sound too terrible. If we can eliminate the
corruption due to free space exxhaustion, it would be a big step
forward.

The next most common failure would be temporary storage failure or
storage communication failure.

Permanent storage failure is "game over" so we don't need to worry about
that.

Just for the record, I tried the test case with ZFS on Ubuntu 17.10 host with ZFS on Linux 0.6.5.11.

ZFS does not swallow the fsync error, but the system does not handle the
error nicely: the test case program hangs on fsync, the load jumps up
and there's a bunch of z\_wr\_iss and z\_null\_int kernel threads belonging
to zfs, eating up the CPU.

Even then I managed to reboot the system, so it's not a complete and
utter mess.

Random other thing we should look at: Some filesystems (nfs yes, xfs
ext4 no) flush writes at close(2). We check close() return code, just
log it... So close() counts as an fsync for such filesystems().

Well, that's interesting. You might remember that NFS does not reserve
space for writes like local file systems like ext4/xfs do. For that
reason, we might be able to capture the out-of-space error on close and
exit sooner for NFS.

It seems like some implementations flush on close and therefore
discover ENOSPC problem at that point, unless they have NVSv4 (RFC
3050) "write delegation" with a promise from the server that a certain
amount of space is available. It seems like you can't count on that
in any way though, because it's the server that decides when to
delegate and how much space to promise is preallocated, not the
client. So in userspace you always need to be able to handle errors
including ENOSPC returned by close(), and if you ignore that and
you're using an operating system that immediately incinerates all
evidence after telling you that (so that later fsync() doesn't fail),
you're in trouble.

Some relevant code:

- [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5445b1fbd123420bffed5e629a420aa2a16bf849](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5445b1fbd123420bffed5e629a420aa2a16bf849)
- [https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sys/fs/nfsclient/nfs\_clvnops.c#L618](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sys/fs/nfsclient/nfs_clvnops.c#L618)

It looks like the bleeding edge of the NFS spec includes a new
ALLOCATE operation that should be able to support posix\_fallocate()
(if we were to start using that for extending files):

[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7862#page-64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7862#page-64)

I'm not sure how reliable \[posix\_\]fallocate is on NFS in general
though, and it seems that there are fall-back implementations of
posix\_fallocate() that write zeros (or even just feign success?) which
probably won't do anything useful here if not also flushed (that
fallback strategy might only work on eager reservation filesystems
that don't have direct fallocate support?) so there are several layers
(libc, kernel, nfs client, nfs server) that'd need to be aligned for
that to work, and it's not clear how a humble userspace program is
supposed to know if they are.

I guess if you could find a way to amortise the cost of extending
(like Oracle et al do by extending big container datafiles 10MB at a
time or whatever), then simply writing zeros and flushing when doing
that might work out OK, so you wouldn't need such a thing? (Unless of
course it's a COW filesystem, but that's a different can of worms.)

Later in the thread it becomes apparent that it applies to ext4 (NFS

Hi Joshua,

This isn't actually an ext4 issue, but a long-standing VFS/MM issue.

There are going to be multiple opinions about what the right thing to
do. I'll try to give as unbiased a description as possible, but
certainly some of this is going to be filtered by my own biases no
matter how careful I can be.

First of all, what storage devices will do when they hit an exception
condition is quite non-deterministic. For example, the vast majority
of SSD's are not power fail certified. What this means is that if
they suffer a power drop while they are doing a GC, it is quite
possible for data written six months ago to be lost as a result. The
LBA could potentialy be far, far away from any LBA's that were
recently written, and there could have been multiple CACHE FLUSH
operations in the since the LBA in question was last written six
months ago. No matter; for a consumer-grade SSD, it's possible for
that LBA to be trashed after an unexpected power drop.

Which is why after a while, one can get quite paranoid and assume that
the only way you can guarantee data robustness is to store multiple
copies and/or use erasure encoding, with some of the copies or shards
written to geographically diverse data centers.

Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of the
companies who require data robustness, and are either willing to pay
$$$ to an enterprise distro company like Red Hat, or command a large
enough paying customer base that they can afford to dictate terms to
an enterprise distro, or hire a consultant such as Christoph, or have
their own staffed Linux kernel teams, have tended to use O\_DIRECT. So
for better or for worse, there has not been as much investment in
buffered I/O and data robustness in the face of exception handling of
storage devices.

Next, the reason why fsync() has the behaviour that it does is one
ofhe the most common cases of I/O storage errors in buffered use
cases, certainly as seen by the community distros, is the user who
pulls out USB stick while it is in use. In that case, if there are
dirtied pages in the page cache, the question is what can you do?
Sooner or later the writes will time out, and if you leave the pages
dirty, then it effectively becomes a permanent memory leak. You can't
unmount the file system --- that requires writing out all of the pages
such that the dirty bit is turned off. And if you don't clear the
dirty bit on an I/O error, then they can never be cleaned. You can't
even re-insert the USB stick; the re-inserted USB stick will get a new
block device. Worse, when the USB stick was pulled, it will have
suffered a power drop, and see above about what could happen after a
power drop for non-power fail certified flash devices --- it goes
double for the cheap sh\*t USB sticks found in the checkout aisle of
Micro Center.

So this is the explanation for why Linux handles I/O errors by
clearing the dirty bit after reporting the error up to user space.
And why there is not eagerness to solve the problem simply by "don't
clear the dirty bit". For every one Postgres installation that might
have a better recover after an I/O error, there's probably a thousand
clueless Fedora and Ubuntu users who will have a much worse user
experience after a USB stick pull happens.

I can think of things that could be done --- for example, it could be
switchable on a per-block device basis (or maybe a per-mount basis)
whether or not the dirty bit gets cleared after the error is reported
to userspace. And perhaps there could be a new unmount flag that
causes all dirty pages to be wiped out, which could be used to recover
after a permanent loss of the block device. But the question is who
is going to invest the time to make these changes? If there is a
company who is willing to pay to comission this work, it's almost
certainly soluble. Or if a company which has a kernel on staff is
willing to direct an engineer to work on it, it certainly could be
solved. But again, of the companies who have client code where we
care about robustness and proper handling of failed disk drives, and
which have a kernel team on staff, pretty much all of the ones I can
think of (e.g., Oracle, Google, etc.) use O\_DIRECT and they don't try
to make buffered writes and error reporting via fsync(2) work well.

In general these companies want low-level control over buffer cache
eviction algorithms, which drives them towards the design decision of
effectively implementing the page cache in userspace, and using
O\_DIRECT reads/writes.

Yes, this is a very long thread. The summary is Postgres is unhappy that
fsync() on Linux (and also other OSes) returns an error once if there was
a prior write() failure, instead of keeping dirty pages in memory forever
and trying to rewrite them.

This behaviour has existed on Linux forever, and (for better or worse) is
the only reasonable behaviour that the kernel can take. I've argued for
the opposite behaviour at times, and some subsystems already do limited
retries before finally giving up on a failed write, though there are also
times when retrying at lower levels is pointless if a higher level of
code can handle the failure (e.g. mirrored block devices, filesystem data
mirroring, userspace data mirroring, or cross-node replication).

The confusion is whether fsync() is a "level" state (return error forever
if there were pages that could not be written), or an "edge" state (return
error only for any write failures since the previous fsync() call).

I think Anthony Iliopoulos was pretty clear in his multiple descriptions
in that thread of why the current behaviour is needed (OOM of the whole
system if dirty pages are kept around forever), but many others were stuck
on "I can't believe this is happening??? This is totally unacceptable and
every kernel needs to change to match my expectations!!!" without looking
at the larger picture of what is practical to change and where the issue
should best be fixed.

Regardless of why this is the case, the net is that PG needs to deal with
all of the systems that currently exist that have this behaviour, even if
some day in the future it may change (though that is unlikely). It seems
ironic that "keep dirty pages in userspace until fsync() returns success"
is totally unacceptable, but "keep dirty pages in the kernel" is fine.
My (limited) understanding of databases was that they preferred to cache
everything in userspace and use O\_DIRECT to write to disk (which returns
an error immediately if the write fails and does not double buffer data).

Guh. I was not aware of this. I knew consumer-grade SSDs often do not have
power loss protection, but still thought they´d handle garble collection in an
atomic way. Sometimes I am tempted to sing an "all hardware is crap" song
(starting with Meltdown/Spectre, then probably heading over to storage devices
and so on… including firmware crap like Intel ME).

When you removed a floppy disk from the drive while the OS was writing to it
it showed a "You MUST insert volume somename into drive somedrive:" and if
you did, it just continued writing. (The part that did not work well was that
with the original filesystem if you did not insert it back, the whole disk was
corrupted, usually to the point beyond repair, so the "MUST" was no joke.)

In my opinion from a user´s point of view this is the only sane way to handle
the premature removal of removable media. I have read of a GSoC project to
implement something like this for NetBSD but I did not check on the outcome of
it. But in MS-DOS I think there has been something similar, however MS-DOS is
not an multitasking operating system as AmigaOS is.

Implementing something like this for Linux would be quite a feat, I think,
cause in addition to the implementation in the kernel, the desktop environment
or whatever other userspace you use would need to handle it as well, so you´d
have to adapt udev / udisks / probably Systemd. And probably this behavior
needs to be restricted to anything that is really removable and even then in
order to prevent memory exhaustion in case processes continue to write to an
removed and not yet re-inserted USB harddisk the kernel would need to halt I/O
processes which dirty I/O to this device. (I believe this is what AmigaOS did.
It just blocked all subsequent I/O to the device still it was re-inserted. But
then the I/O handling in that OS at that time is quite different from what
Linux does.)

I was not aware that flash based media may be as crappy as you hint at.

That's a bit of a cop out. It's not just databases that care. Even more
basic tools like SCM, package managers and editors care whether they can
proper responses back from fsync that imply things actually were synced.

I don't think these necessarily are as contradictory goals as you paint
them. At least in postgres' case we can deal with the fact that an
fsync retry isn't going to fix the problem by reentering crash recovery
or just shutting down - therefore we don't need to keep all the dirty
buffers around. A per-inode or per-superblock bit that causes further
fsyncs to fail would be entirely sufficent for that.

While there's some differing opinions on the referenced postgres thread,
the fundamental problem isn't so much that a retry won't fix the
problem, it's that we might NEVER see the failure. If writeback happens
in the background, encounters an error, undirties the buffer, we will
happily carry on because we've never seen that. That's when we're
majorly screwed.

Both in postgres, _and_ a lot of other applications, it's not at all
guaranteed to consistently have one FD open for every file
writtten. Therefore even the more recent per-fd errseq logic doesn't
guarantee that the failure will ever be seen by an application
diligently fsync()ing.

You'd not even need to have per inode information or such in the case
that the block device goes away entirely. As the FS isn't generally
unmounted in that case, you could trivially keep a per-mount (or
superblock?) bit that says "I died" and set that instead of keeping per
inode/whatever information.

I find it a bit dissapointing response. I think it's fair to say that
for advanced features, but we're talking about the basic guarantee that
fsync actually does something even remotely reasonable.

I don't think that's the full issue. We can deal with the fact that an
fsync failure is edge-triggered if there's a guarantee that every
process doing so would get it. The fact that one needs to have an FD
open from before any failing writes occurred to get a failure, _THAT'S_
the big issue.

Beyond postgres, it's a pretty common approach to do work on a lot of
files without fsyncing, then iterate over the directory fsync
everything, and _then_ assume you're safe. But unless I severaly
misunderstand something that'd only be safe if you kept an FD for every
file open, which isn't realistic for pretty obvious reasons.

Sure, but it is mostly PG that is doing (IMHO) crazy things like writing
to thousands(?) of files, closing the file descriptors, then expecting
fsync() on a newly-opened fd to return a historical error. If an editor
tries to write a file, then calls fsync and gets an error, the user will
enter a new pathname and retry the write. The package manager will assume
the package installation failed, and uninstall the parts of the package
that were already written.

There is no way the filesystem can handle the package manager failure case,
and keeping the pages dirty and retrying indefinitely may never work (e.g.
disk is dead or disconnected, is a sparse volume without any free space,
etc). This (IMHO) implies that the higher layer (which knows more about
what the write failure implies) needs to deal with this.

I think there are two issues here - "fsync() on an fd that was just opened"
and "persistent error state (without keeping dirty pages in memory)".

If there is background data writeback _without an open file descriptor_,
there is no mechanism for the kernel to return an error to any application
which may exist, or may not ever come back.

Consider if there was a per-inode "there was once an error writing this
inode" flag. Then fsync() would return an error on the inode forever,
since there is no way in POSIX to clear this state, since it would need
to be kept in case some new fd is opened on the inode and does an fsync()
and wants the error to be returned.

IMHO, the only alternative would be to keep the dirty pages in memory
until they are written to disk. If that was not possible, what then?
It would need a reboot to clear the dirty pages, or truncate the file
(discarding all data)?

... only if the application closes all fds for the file before calling
fsync. If any fd is kept open from the time of the failure, it will
return the original error on fsync() (and then no longer return it).

It's not that you need to keep every fd open forever. You could put them
into a shared pool, and re-use them if the file is "re-opened", and call
fsync on each fd before it is closed (because the pool is getting too big
or because you want to flush the data for that file, or shut down the DB).
That wouldn't require a huge re-architecture of PG, just a small library
to handle the shared fd pool.

That might even improve performance, because opening and closing files
is itself not free, especially if you are working with remote filesystems.

The filesystem will definitely return an error in this case, I don't
think this needs any kind of changes:

int ext4\_sync\_file(struct file \*file, loff\_t start, loff\_t end, int datasync)
{
if (unlikely(ext4\_forced\_shutdown(EXT4\_SB(inode->i\_sb))))
return -EIO;

Linux (as PG) is run by people who develop it for their own needs, or
are paid to develop it for the needs of others. Everyone already has
too much work to do, so you need to find someone who has an interest
in fixing this (IMHO very peculiar) use case. If PG developers want
to add a tunable "keep dirty pages in RAM on IO failure", I don't think
that it would be too hard for someone to do. It might be harder to
convince some of the kernel maintainers to accept it, and I've been on
the losing side of that battle more than once. However, like everything
you don't pay for, you can't require someone else to do this for you.
It wouldn't hurt to see if Jeff Layton, who wrote the errseq patches,
would be interested to work on something like this.

That said, _even_ if a fix was available for Linux tomorrow, it would
be _years_ before a majority of users would have it available on their
system, that includes even the errseq mechanism that was landed a few
months ago. That implies to me that you'd want something that fixes PG
_now_ so that it works around whatever (perceived) breakage exists in
the Linux fsync() implementation. Since the thread indicates that
non-Linux kernels have the same fsync() behaviour, it makes sense to do
that even if the Linux fix was available.

I can't say how common or uncommon such a workload is, though PG is the
only application that I've heard of doing it, and I've been working on
filesystems for 20 years. I'm a bit surprised that anyone expects
fsync() on a newly-opened fd to have any state from write() calls that
predate the open. I can understand fsync() returning an error for any
IO that happens within the context of that fsync(), but how far should
it go back for reporting errors on that file? Forever? The only
way to clear the error would be to reboot the system, since I'm not
aware of any existing POSIX code to clear such an error

Yeah, this seems like a recipe for disaster, especially on
cross-platform code where every OS platform behaves differently and
almost never to expectation.

And speaking of "behaving differently to expectations", nobody has
mentioned that close() can also return write errors. Hence if you do
write - close - open - fsync the the write error might get reported
on close, not fsync. IOWs, the assumption that "async writeback
errors will persist across close to open" is fundamentally broken to
begin with. It's even documented as a slient data loss vector in
the close(2) man page:

```
$ man 2 close
.....
   Dealing with error returns from close()

	  A careful programmer will check the return value of
	  close(), since it is quite possible that  errors  on  a
	  previous  write(2)  operation  are reported  only on the
	  final close() that releases the open file description.
	  Failing to check the return value when closing a file may
	  lead to silent loss of data.  This can especially be
	  observed with NFS and with disk quota.

```

Yeah, ensuring data integrity in the face of IO errors is a really
hard problem. :/

To pound the broken record: there are many good reasons why Linux
filesystem developers have said "you should use direct IO" to the PG
devs each time we have this "the kernel doesn't do \[complex things
PG needs\]" discussion.

In this case, robust IO error reporting is easy with DIO. It's one
of the reasons most of the high performance database engines are
either using or moving to non-blocking AIO+DIO (RWF\_NOWAIT) and use
O\_DSYNC/RWF\_DSYNC for integrity-critical IO dispatch. This is also
being driven by the availability of high performance, high IOPS
solid state storage where buffering in RAM to optimise IO patterns
and throughput provides no real performance benefit.

Using the AIO+DIO infrastructure ensures errors are reported for the
specific write that fails at failure time (i.e. in the aio
completion event for the specific IO), yet high IO throughput can be
maintained without the application needing it's own threading
infrastructure to prevent blocking.

This means the application doesn't have to guess where the write
error occurred to retry/recover, have to handle async write errors
on close(), have to use fsync() to gather write IO errors and then
infer where the IO failure was, or require kernels on every
supported platform to jump through hoops to try to do exactly the
right thing in error conditions for everyone in all circumstances at
all times....

It's not just postgres. dpkg (underlying apt, on debian derived distros)
to take an example I just randomly guessed, does too:

```
  /* We want to guarantee the extracted files are on the disk, so that the
   * subsequent renames to the info database do not end up with old or zero
   * length files in case of a system crash. As neither dpkg-deb nor tar do
   * explicit fsync()s, we have to do them here.
   * XXX: This could be avoided by switching to an internal tar extractor. */
  dir_sync_contents(cidir);

```

(a bunch of other places too)

Especially on ext3 but also on newer filesystems it's performancewise
entirely infeasible to fsync() every single file individually - the
performance becomes entirely attrocious if you do that.

I think there's some legitimate arguments that a database should use
direct IO (more on that as a reply to David), but claiming that all
sorts of random utilities need to use DIO with buffering etc is just
insane.

Except that they won't notice that they got a failure, at least in the

Yea, I agree that'd not be sane. As far as I understand the dpkg code
(all of 10min reading it), that'd also be unnecessary. It can abort the
installation, but only if it detects the error. Which isn't happening.

And that's _horrible_. If I cp a file, and writeback fails in the
background, and I then cat that file before restarting, I should be able
to see that that failed. Instead of returning something bogus.

Or even more extreme, you untar/zip/git clone a directory. Then do a
sync. And you don't know whether anything actually succeeded.

The data in the file also is corrupt. Having to unmount or delete the
file to reset the fact that it can't safely be assumed to be on disk
isn't insane.

Except that postgres uses multiple processes. And works on a lot of
architectures. If we started to fsync all opened files on process exit
our users would _lynch_ us. We'd need a complicated scheme that sends
processes across sockets between processes, then deduplicate them on the
receiving side, somehow figuring out which is the oldest filedescriptors
(handling clockdrift safely).

Note that it'd be perfectly fine that we've "thrown away" the buffer
contents if we'd get notified that the fsync failed. We could just do
WAL replay, and restore the contents (just was we do after crashes
and/or for replication).

Well, I'm making that argument because several people argued that
throwing away buffer contents in this case is the only way to not cause
OOMs, and that that's incompatible with reporting errors. It's clearly
not...

I personally am on board with doing that. But you also gotta recognize
that an efficient DIO usage is a metric ton of work, and you need a
large amount of differing logic for different platforms. It's just not
realistic to do so for every platform. Postgres is developed by a small
number of people, isn't VC backed etc. The amount of resources we can
throw at something is fairly limited. I'm hoping to work on adding
linux DIO support to pg, but I'm sure as hell not going to do be able to
do the same on windows (solaris, hpux, aix, ...) etc.

And there's cases where that just doesn't help at all. Being able to
untar a database from backup / archive / timetravel / whatnot, and then
fsyncing the directory tree to make sure it's actually safe, is really
not an insane idea. Or even just cp -r ing it, and then starting up a
copy of the database. What you're saying is that none of that is doable
in a safe way, unless you use special-case DIO using tooling for the
whole operation (or at least tools that fsync carefully without ever
closing a fd, which certainly isn't the case for cp et al).

Most of that sounds like a good thing to do, but you got to recognize

And before somebody argues that that's a too small window to trigger the
problem realistically: Restoring large databases happens pretty commonly
(for new replicas, testcases, or actual fatal issues), takes time, and
it's where a lot of storage is actually written to for the first time in
a while, so it's far from unlikely to trigger bad block errors or such.

At the moment, when we open a file, we sample the current state of the
writeback error and only report new errors. We could set it to zero
instead, and report the most recent error as soon as anything happens
which would report an error. That way err = close(open("file")); would
report the most recent error.

That's not going to be persistent across the data structure for that inode
being removed from memory; we'd need filesystem support for persisting
that. But maybe it's "good enough" to only support it for recent files.

Jeff, what do you think?

I know it's not what PG has chosen, but realistically all of the other
major databases and userspace based storage systems have used DIO
precisely _because_ it's the way to avoid OS-specific behavior or
require OS-specific code. DIO is simple, and pretty much the same
everywhere.

In contrast, the exact details of how buffered I/O workrs can be quite
different on different OS's. This is especially true if you take
performance related details (e.g., the cleaning algorithm, how pages
get chosen for eviction, etc.)

As I read the PG-hackers thread, I thought I saw acknowledgement that
some of the behaviors you don't like with Linux also show up on other
Unix or Unix-like systems?

If there is no open file descriptor, and in many cases, no process
(because it has already exited), it may be horrible, but what the h\*ll
else do you expect the OS to do?

The solution we use at Google is that we watch for I/O errors using a
completely different process that is responsible for monitoring
machine health. It used to scrape dmesg, but we now arrange to have
I/O errors get sent via a netlink channel to the machine health
monitoring daemon. If it detects errors on a particular hard drive,
it tells the cluster file system to stop using that disk, and to
reconstruct from erasure code all of the data chunks on that disk onto
other disks in the cluster. We then run a series of disk diagnostics
to make sure we find all of the bad sectors (every often, where there
is one bad sector, there are several more waiting to be found), and
then afterwards, put the disk back into service.

By making it be a separate health monitoring process, we can have HDD
experts write much more sophisticated code that can ask the disk
firmware for more information (e.g., SMART, the grown defect list), do
much more careful scrubbing of the disk media, etc., before returning
the disk back to service.

The reality is that recovering from disk errors is tricky business,
and I very much doubt most userspace applications, including distro
package managers, are going to want to engineer for trying to detect
and recover from disk errors. If that were true, then Red Hat and/or
SuSE have kernel engineers, and they would have implemented everything
everything on your wish list. They haven't, and that should tell you
something.

The other reality is that once a disk starts developing errors, in
reality you will probably need to take the disk off-line, scrub it to
find any other media errors, and there's a good chance you'll need to
rewrite bad sectors (incluing some which are on top of file system
metadata, so you probably will have to run fsck or reformat the whole
file system). I certainly don't think it's realistic to assume adding
lots of sophistication to each and every userspace program.

If you have tens or hundreds of thousands of disk drives, then you
will need to do tsomething automated, but I claim that you really
don't want to smush all of that detailed exception handling and HDD
repair technology into each database or cluster file system component.
It really needs to be done in a separate health-monitor and
machine-level management system.

Yes it is.

This is what syncfs() is for - making sure a large amount of of data
and metadata spread across many files and subdirectories in a single
filesystem is pushed to stable storage in the most efficient manner
possible.

No, Just saying fsyncing individual files and directories is about
the most inefficient way you could possible go about doing this.

Does not seem like a problem to me, just checksum the thing if you
really need to be extra safe. You should probably be doing it anyway if
you backup / archive / timetravel / whatnot.

What are you expecting to happen in this case? Are you expecting a read
error due to a writeback failure? Or are you just saying that we should
be invalidating pages that failed to be written back, so that they can
be re-read?

I hate it :). We could do that, but....yecchhhh.

Reporting errors only in the case where the inode happened to stick
around in the cache seems too unreliable for real-world usage, and might
be problematic for some use cases. I'm also not sure it would really be
helpful.

I think the crux of the matter here is not really about error reporting,
per-se. I asked this at LSF last year, and got no real answer:

When there is a writeback error, what should be done with the dirty
page(s)? Right now, we usually just mark them clean and carry on. Is
that the right thing to do?

One possibility would be to invalidate the range that failed to be
written (or the whole file) and force the pages to be faulted in again
on the next access. It could be surprising for some applications to not
see the results of their writes on a subsequent read after such an
event.

Maybe that's ok in the face of a writeback error though? IDK.

Yeah, it's definitely half-arsed. We could make further changes to
improve the situation, but they'd have wider impact. For example, we can
tell if the error has been sampled by any existing fd, so we could bias
our inode reaping to have inodes with unreported errors stick around in
the cache for longer.

I suspect it isn't. If there's a transient error then we should reattempt
the write. OTOH if the error is permanent then reattempting the write
isn't going to do any good and it's just going to cause the drive to go
through the whole error handling dance again. And what do we do if we're
low on memory and need these pages back to avoid going OOM? There's a
lot of options here, all of them bad in one situation or another.

I don't know either. It'd force the application to face up to the fact
that the data is gone immediately rather than only finding it out after
a reboot. Again though that might cause more problems than it solves.
It's hard to know what the right thing to do is.

Just note that the error return from syncfs is somewhat iffy. It doesn't
necessarily return an error when one inode fails to be written back. I
think it mainly returns errors when you get a metadata writeback error.

You can still use syncfs but what you'd probably have to do is call
syncfs while you still hold all of the fd's open, and then fsync each
one afterward to ensure that they all got written back properly. That
should work as you'd expect.

Not to mention a POSIX IO ordering violation. Seeing stale data
after a "successful" write is simply not allowed.

> Maybe that's ok in the face of a writeback error though? IDK.

No matter what we do for async writeback error handling, it will be
slightly different from filesystem to filesystem, not to mention OS
to OS. The is no magic bullet here, so I'm not sure we should worry
too much. There's direct IO for anyone who cares that need to know
about the completion status of every single write IO....

That's the problem. The best that could be done (and it's not enough)
would be to have a mode which does with the PG folks want (or what
they _think_ they want). It seems what they want is to have an error
result in the page being marked clean. When they discover the outcome
(OOM-city and the unability to unmount a file system on a failed
drive), then they will complain to us _again_, at which point we can
tell them that want they really want is another variation on O\_PONIES,
and welcome to the real world and real life.

Which is why, even if they were to pay someone to implement what they
want, I'm not sure we would want to accept it upstream --- or distro's
might consider it a support nightmare, and refuse to allow that mode
to be enabled on enterprise distro's. But at least, it will have been
some PG-based company who will have implemented it, so they're not
wasting other people's time or other people's resources...

We could try to get something like what Google is doing upstream,
which is to have the I/O errors sent to userspace via a netlink
channel (without changing anything else about how buffered writeback
is handled in the face of errors). Then userspace applications could
switch to Direct I/O like all of the other really serious userspace
storage solutions I'm aware of, and then someone could try to write
some kind of HDD health monitoring system that tries to do the right
thing when a disk is discovered to have developed some media errors or
something more serious (e.g., a head failure). That plus some kind of
RAID solution is I think the only thing which is really realistic for
a typical PG site.

It's certainly that's what _I_ would do if I didn't decide to use a
hosted cloud solution, such as Cloud SQL for Postgres, and let someone
else solve the really hard problems of dealing with real-world HDD
failures. :-)

I'm not so sure here, given that we're dealing with an error condition.
Are we really obligated not to allow any changes to pages that we can't
write back?

Given that the pages are clean after these failures, we aren't doing
this even today:

Suppose we're unable to do writes but can do reads vs. the backing
store. After a wb failure, the page has the dirty bit cleared. If it
gets kicked out of the cache before the read occurs, it'll have to be
faulted back in. Poof -- your write just disappeared.

That can even happen before you get the chance to call fsync, so even a
write()+read()+fsync() is not guaranteed to be safe in this regard
today, given sufficient memory pressure.

I think the current situation is fine from a "let's not OOM at all
costs" standpoint, but not so good for application predictability. We
should really consider ways to do better here.

I think we we have an opportunity here to come up with better defined
and hopefully more useful behavior for buffered I/O in the face of
writeback errors. The first step would be to hash out what we'd want it
to look like.

Maybe we need a plenary session at LSF/MM?

That doesn't really help, unless you want to sync() and then re-read all
the data to make sure it's the same. Rereading multi-TB backups just to
know whether there was an error that the OS knew about isn't
particularly fun. Without verifying after sync it's not going to improve
the situation measurably, you're still only going to discover that $data
isn't available when it's needed.

What you're saying here is that there's no way to use standard linux
tools to manipulate files and know whether it failed, without filtering
kernel logs for IO errors. Or am I missing something?

Any pointers to that the underling netlink mechanism? If we can force
postgres to kill itself when such an error is detected (via a dedicated
monitoring process), I'd personally be happy enough. It'd be nicer if
we could associate that knowledge with particular filesystems etc
(which'd possibly hard through dm etc?), but this'd be much better than
nothing.

The problem really isn't about _recovering_ from disk errors. _Knowing_
about them is the crucial part. We do not want to give back clients the
information that an operation succeeded, when it actually didn't. There
could be improvements above that, but as long as it's guaranteed that
"we" get the error (rather than just some kernel log we don't have
access to, which looks different due to config etc), it's ok. We can
throw our hands up in the air and give up.

Yea, agreed on all that. I don't think anybody actually involved in
postgres wants to do anything like that. Seems far outside of postgres'
remit.

I think a per-file or even per-blockdev/fs error state that'd be
returned by fsync() would be more than sufficient. I don't see that
that'd realistically would trigger OOM or the inability to unmount a
filesystem. If the drive is entirely gone there's obviously no point in
keeping per-file information around, so per-blockdev/fs information
suffices entirely to return an error on fsync (which at least on ext4
appears to happen if the underlying blockdev is gone).

Have fun making up things we want, but I'm not sure it's particularly
productive.

Well, that's why I'm discussing here so we can figure out what's
acceptable before considering wasting money and revew cycles doing or

Ah, darn. After you'd mentioned that in an earlier mail I'd hoped that'd
be upstream. And yes, that'd be perfect.

As I said earlier, I think there's good reason to move to DIO for
postgres. But to keep that performant is going to need some serious
work.

But afaict such a solution wouldn't really depend on applications using
DIO or not. Before finishing a checkpoint (logging it persistently and
allowing to throw older data away), we could check if any errors have
been reported and give up if there have been any. And after starting
postgres on a directory restored from backup using $tool, we can fsync
the directory recursively, check for such errors, and give up if
there've been any.

Yes, I'd hope for a read error after a writeback failure. I think that's
sane behaviour. But I don't really care _that_ much.

At the very least _some_ way to _know_ that such a failure occurred from
userland without having to parse the kernel log. As far as I understand,
neither sync(2) (and thus sync(1)) nor syncfs(2) is guaranteed to report
an error if it was encountered by writeback in the background.

If that's indeed true for syncfs(2), even if the fd has been opened
before (which I can see how it could happen from an implementation POV,
nothing would associate a random FD with failures on different files),
it's really impossible to detect this stuff from userland without text
parsing.

Even if it'd were just a perf-fs /sys/$something file that'd return the
current count of unreported errors in a filesystem independent way, it'd
be better than what we have right now.

```
1) figure out /sys/$whatnot $directory belongs to
2) oldcount=$(cat /sys/$whatnot/unreported_errors)
3) filesystem operations in $directory
4) sync;sync;
5) newcount=$(cat /sys/$whatnot/unreported_errors)
6) test "$oldcount" -eq "$newcount" || die-with-horrible-message

```

Isn't beautiful to script, but it's also not absolutely terrible.

Ah; this was my suggestion to Jeff on IRC. That we add a per-superblock
wb\_err and then allow syncfs() to return it. So you'd open an fd on
a directory (for example), and call syncfs() which would return -EIO
or -ENOSPC if either of those conditions had occurred since you opened
the fd.

Ted's referring to the current state of affairs where the writeback error
is held in the inode; if we can't evict the inode because it's holding
the error indicator, that can send us OOM. If instead we transfer the
error indicator to the superblock, then there's no problem.

syncfs isn't standardized, it operates on an entire filesystem (thus
writing out unnecessary stuff), it has no meaningful documentation of
it's return codes. Yes, using syncfs() might better performancewise,
but it doesn't seem like it actually solves anything, performance aside:

Which again doesn't allow one to use any non-bespoke tooling (like tar
or whatnot). And it means you'll have to call syncfs() every few hundred
files, because you'll obviously run into filehandle limitations.

Not a bad idea and shouldn't be too costly. mapping\_set\_error could
flag the superblock one before or after the one in the mapping.

We'd need to define what happens if you interleave fsync and syncfs
calls on the same inode though. How do we handle file->f\_wb\_err in that
case? Would we need a second field in struct file to act as the per-sb
error cursor?

When or how would the per-superblock wb\_err flag get cleared?

Would all subsequent fsync() calls on that file system now return EIO?
Or would only all subsequent syncfs() calls return EIO?

Actually, I was referring to the pg-hackers original ask, which was
that after an error, all of the dirty pages that couldn't be written
out would stay dirty.

If it's only as single inode which is pinned in memory with the dirty
flag, that's bad, but it's not as bad as pinning all of the memory
pages for which there was a failed write. We would still need to
invent some mechanism or define some semantic when it would be OK to
clear the per-inode flag and let the memory associated with that
pinned inode get released, though.

That's not how errseq works, Ted ;-)

Only ones which occur after the last sampling get reported through this

I'll have to respectfully disagree. Why should I interpret an error on
a read() syscall to mean that writeback failed? Note that the data is
still potentially intact.

What _might_ make sense, IMO, is to just invalidate the pages that
failed to be written back. Then you could potentially do a read to
fault them in again (i.e. sync the pagecache and the backing store) and
possibly redirty them for another try.

Note that you can detect this situation by checking the return code
from fsync. It should report the latest error once per file
description.

syncfs could use some work.

I'm warming to willy's idea to add a per-sb errseq\_t. I think that
might be a simple way to get better semantics here. Not sure how we
want to handle the reporting end yet though...

We probably also need to consider how to better track metadata
writeback errors (on e.g. ext2). We don't really do that properly at
quite yet either.

Ooh. I hadn't thought that through. Bleh. I don't want to add a field
to struct file for this uncommon case.

Maybe O\_PATH could be used for this? It gets you a file descriptor on
a particular filesystem, so syncfs() is defined, but it can't report
a writeback error. So if you open something O\_PATH, you can use the
file's f\_wb\_err for the mapping's error cursor.

I don't think unmount + resettable via /sys would be an insane
approach. Requiring explicit action to acknowledge data loss isn't a
crazy concept. But I think that's something reasonable minds could
disagree with.

If it were tied to syncfs, I wonder if there's a way to have some errseq
type logic. Store a per superblock (or whatever equivalent thing) errseq
value of errors. For each fd calling syncfs() report the error once,
but then store the current value in a separate per-fd field. And if
that's considered too weird, only report the errors to fds that have
been opened from before the error occurred.

I can see writing a tool 'pg\_run\_and\_sync /directo /ries -- command'
which opens an fd for each of the filesystems the directories reside on,
and calls syncfs() after. That'd allow to use backup/restore tools at
least semi safely.

Well, it's an open list, everyone can argue. And initially people at
first didn't know the OOM explanation, and then it takes some time to
revise ones priors :). I think it's a design question that reasonable
people can disagree upon (if "hot" removed devices are handled by
throwing data away regardless, at least). But as it's clearly not
something viable, we can move on to something that can solve the
problem.

Yea, I agree that that's not obvious. One way would be to say that it's
only automatically cleared when you unlink the file. A bit heavyhanded,
but not too crazy.

Yeah, sorry, it never got upstreamed. It's not really all that
complicated, it was just that there were some other folks who wanted
to do something similar, and there was a round of bike-sheddingh
several years ago, and nothing ever went upstream. Part of the
problem was that our orignial scheme sent up information about file
system-level corruption reports --- e.g, those stemming from calls to
ext4\_error() --- and lots of people had different ideas about how tot
get all of the possible information up in some structured format.
(Think something like uerf from Digtial's OSF/1.)

We did something _really_ simple/stupid. We just sent essentially an
ascii test string out the netlink socket. That's because what we were
doing before was essentially scraping the output of dmesg
(e.g. /dev/kmssg).

That's actually probably the simplest thing to do, and it has the
advantage that it will work even on ancient enterprise kernels that PG
users are likely to want to use. So you will need to implement the
dmesg text scraper anyway, and that's probably good enough for most
use cases.

Right, it's a little challenging because the actual regexp's you would
need to use do vary from device driver to device driver. Fortunately
nearly everything is a SCSI/SATA device these days, so there isn't
_that_ much variability.

Some people on the pg-hackers list were talking about wanting to retry
the fsync() and hoping that would cause the write to somehow suceed.
It's _possible_ that might help, but it's not likely to be helpful in
my experience.

ext4 seems to have something roughly like that
(/sys/fs/ext4/$dev/errors\_count), and by my reading it already seems to
be incremented from the necessary places. By my reading XFS doesn't
seem to have something similar.

Wouldn't be bad to standardize...

This is only for file system inconsistencies noticed by the kernel.
We don't bump that count for data block I/O errors.

The same idea could be used on a block device level. It would be
pretty simple to maintain a counter for I/O errors, and when the last
error was detected on a particular device. You could evne break out
and track read errors and write errors eparately if that would be
useful.

If you don't care what block was bad, but just that _some_ I/O error
had happened, a counter is definitely the simplest approach, and less
hair to implemnet and use than something like a netlink channel or
scraping dmesg....

The worst part of that is, as you mention below, needing to handle a lot
of different error message formats. I guess it's reasonable enough if
you control your hardware, but no such luck.

Aren't there quite realistic scenarios where one could miss kmsg style
messages due to it being a ringbuffer?

There's also SAN / NAS type stuff - not all of that presents as a
SCSI/SATA device, right?

Depends on the type of error and storage. ENOSPC, especially over NFS,
has some reasonable chances of being cleared up. And for networked block
storage it's also not impossible to think of scenarios where that'd
work for EIO.

But I think besides hope of clearing up itself, it has the advantage
that it trivially can give _some_ feedback to the user. The user'll get
back strerror(ENOSPC) with some decent SQL error code, which'll
hopefully cause them to investigate (well, once monitoring detects high
error rates). It's much nicer for the user to type COMMIT; get an
appropriate error back etc, than if the database just commits suicide.

Posix says this about write():

```
  After a write() to a regular file has successfully returned:

     Any successful read() from each byte position in the file that
     was modified by that write shall return the data specified by
     the write() for that position until such byte positions are
     again modified.

```

IOWs, even if there is a later error, we told the user the write was
successful, and so according to POSIX we are not allowed to wind
back the data to what it was before the write() occurred.

Yes - I was pointing out what the specification we supposedly
conform to says about this behaviour, not that our current behaviour
conforms to the spec. Indeed, have you even noticed
xfs\_aops\_discard\_page() and it's surrounding context on page
writeback submission errors?

To save you looking, XFS will trash the page contents completely on
a filesystem level ->writepage error. It doesn't mark them "clean",
doesn't attempt to redirty and rewrite them - it clears the uptodate
state and may invalidate it completely. IOWs, the data written
"sucessfully" to the cached page is now gone. It will be re-read
from disk on the next read() call, in direct violation of the above
POSIX requirements.

This is my point: we've done that in XFS knowing that we violate
POSIX specifications in this specific corner case - it's the lesser
of many evils we have to chose between. Hence if we chose to encode
that behaviour as the general writeback IO error handling algorithm,
then it needs to done with the knowledge it is a specification
violation. Not to mention be documented as a POSIX violation in the
various relevant man pages and that this is how all filesystems will
behave on async writeback error.....

That might work.

It'd be a syscall behavioral change so we'd need to document that well.
It's probably innocuous though -- I doubt we have a lot of callers in
the field opening files with O\_PATH and calling syncfs on them.

Got it, thanks.

Yes, I think we ought to probably do the same thing globally. It's nice
to know that xfs has already been doing this. That makes me feel better
about making this behavior the gold standard for Linux filesystems.

So to summarize, at this point in the discussion, I think we want to
consider doing the following:

- better reporting from syncfs (report an error when even one inode failed to be written back since last syncfs call). We'll probably implement this via a per-sb errseq\_t in some fashion, though there are some implementation issues to work out.
- invalidate or clear uptodate flag on pages that experience writeback errors, across filesystems. Encourage this as standard behavior for filesystems and maybe add helpers to make it easier to do this.

Did I miss anything? Would that be enough to help the Pg usecase?

I don't see us ever being able to reasonably support its current
expectation that writeback errors will be seen on fd's that were opened
after the error occurred. That's a really thorny problem from an object
lifetime perspective.

It's not perfect, but I think the amount of hacky OS specific code
should be acceptable. And it does allow for a wrapper tool that can be
used around backup restores etc to syncfs all the necessary filesystems.
Let me mull with others for a bit.

I think we can do better than XFS is currently doing (but I agree that
we should have the same behaviour across all Linux filesystems!)

1. If we get an error while wbc->for\_background is true, we should not clear uptodate on the page, rather SetPageError and SetPageDirty.
2. Background writebacks should skip pages which are PageError.
3. for\_sync writebacks should attempt one last write. Maybe it'll succeed this time. If it does, just ClearPageError. If not, we have somebody to report this writeback error to, and ClearPageUptodate.

I think kupdate writes are the same as for\_background writes. for\_reclaim
is tougher. I don't want to see us getting into OOM because we're hanging
onto stale data, but we don't necessarily have an open fd to report the
error on. I think I'm leaning towards behaving the same for for\_reclaim
as for\_sync, but this is probably a subject on which reasonable people
can disagree.

And this logic all needs to be on one place, although invoked from
each filesystem.

While accepting that under memory pressure we can still evict the error
indicators, we can do a better job than we do today. The current design
of error reporting says that all errors which occurred before you opened
the file descriptor are of no interest to you. I don't think that's
necessarily true, and it's actually a change of behaviour from before
the errseq work.

Consider Stupid Task A which calls open(), write(), close(), and Smart
Task B which calls open(), write(), fsync(), close() operating on the
same file. If A goes entirely before B and encounters an error, before
errseq\_t, B would see the error from A's write.

If A and B overlap, even a little bit, then B still gets to see A's
error today. But if writeback happens for A's write before B opens the
file then B will never see the error.

B doesn't want to see historical errors that a previous invocation of
B has already handled, but we know whether _anyone_ has seen the error
or not. So here's a patch which restores the historical behaviour of
seeing old unhandled errors on a fresh file descriptor:

So you're saying we should treat it as a transient error rather than
a permanent error.

> 1. Background writebacks should skip pages which are PageError.

That seems decidedly dodgy in the case where there is a transient
error - it requires a user to specifically run sync to get the data
to disk after the transient error has occurred. Say they don't
notice the problem because it's fleeting and doesn't cause any
obvious problems?

e.g. XFS gets to enospc, runs out of reserve pool blocks so can't
allocate space to write back the page, then space is freed up a few
seconds later and so the next write will work just fine.

This is a recipe for "I lost data that I wrote /days/ before the
system crashed" bug reports.

Which may well be unmount. Are we really going to wait until unmount
to report fatal errors?

We used to do this with XFS metadata. We'd just keep trying to write
metadata and keep the filesystem running (because it's consistent in
memory and it might be a transient error) rather than shutting down
the filesystem after a couple of retries. the result was that users
wouldn't notice there were problems until unmount, and the most
common sympton of that was "why is system shutdown hanging?".

We now don't hang at unmount by default:

```
$ cat /sys/fs/xfs/dm-0/error/fail_at_unmount
1
$

```

And we treat different errors according to their seriousness. EIO
and device ENOSPC we default to retry forever because they are often
transient, but for ENODEV we fail and shutdown immediately (someone
pulled the USB stick out). metadata failure behaviour is configured
via changing fields in /sys/fs/xfs//error/metadata//...

We've planned to extend this failure configuration to data IO, too,
but never quite got around to it yet. this is a clear example of
"one size doesn't fit all" and I think we'll end up doing the same
sort of error behaviour configuration in XFS for these cases.
(i.e. /sys/fs/xfs//error/writeback//....)

Perhaps so, but as there's no "one-size-fits-all" behaviour, I
really want to extend the XFS error config infrastructure to control
what the filesystem does on error here.

Yes, I'm proposing leaving the data in memory in case the user wants to
try writing it somewhere else.

That's fair. What I want to avoid is triggering the same error every
30 seconds (or whatever the periodic writeback threshold is set to).

Goodness, no. The errors would be immediately reportable using the wb\_err
mechanism, as soon as the first error was encountered.

Pointers to documentation or papers or anything? The only google
results I can find for "power fail certified" are your posts.

I've always been confused by SSD power-loss protection, as nobody seems
completely clear whether it's a safety or a performance feature.

Is that still true if you're able to use some kind of parallelism?

That's for metadata writeback error behaviour, not data writeback
IO errors.

We are definitely not planning to add mount options to configure IO
error behaviors. Mount options are a horrible way to configure
filesystem behaviour and we've already got other, fine-grained
configuration infrastructure for configuring IO error behaviour.
Which, as I just pointed out, was designed to be be extended to data
writeback and other operational error handling in the filesystem
(e.g. dealing with ENOMEM in different ways).

So if kernel ring buffer overflows and so users miss the first error
report, they'll have no idea that the data writeback is still
failing?

Maybe, but I don't think that actually helps anything and adds yet

But if there are no open files when the error occurs, that error
won't get reported to anyone. Which means the next time anyone
accesses that inode from a user context could very well be unmount
or a third party sync/syncfs()....

/me points casually at data\_err=abort & data\_err=ignore in ext4...

```
       data_err=ignore
              Just print an error message if an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode.

       data_err=abort
              Abort the journal if an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode.

```

I don't disagree, but there are already mount-option knobs in ext4, FWIW.

I've been thinking about this. Ideally we want to pass some kind of
notification all the way up to the desktop and tell the user to plug the
damn stick back in. Then have the USB stick become the same blockdev
that it used to be, and complete the writeback. We are so far from
being able to do that right now that it's not even funny.

I wasn't thinking about kernel ringbuffer based reporting; I was thinking
about errseq\_t based reporting, so the application can tell the fsync
failed and maybe does something application-level to recover like send
the transactions across to another node in the cluster (or whatever this
hypothetical application is).

Right. But then that's on the application.

Maybe we shouldn't be trying to do any of this in the kernel, or at
least as little as possible in the kernel? Perhaps it would be better
to do most of this as a device mapper hack; I suspect we'll need
userspace help to igure out whether the user has plugged the same USB
stick in, or a different USB stick, anyway.

Devices from reputable vendors should always be power fail safe, bugs
notwithstanding. What power-loss protection in marketing slides usually
means is that an SSD has a non-volatile write cache. That is once a
write is ACKed data is persisted and no additional cache flush needs to
be sent. This is a feature only available in expensive eterprise SSDs
as the required capacitors are expensive. Cheaper consumer or boot
driver SSDs have a volatile write cache, that is we need to do a
separate cache flush to persist data (REQ\_OP\_FLUSH in Linux). But
a reasonable implementation of those still won't corrupt previously
written data, they will just lose the volatile write cache that hasn't
been flushed. Occasional bugs, bad actors or other issues might still
happen.

Thanks! That was my understanding too. But then the name is terrible.
As is all the vendor documentation I can find:

Why do they all neglect to mention that their consumer drives are also
perfectly capable of well-defined behavior after power loss, just at the
expense of flush performance? It's ridiculously confusing.

The device mapper target (dm-removable?) was my first idea too, but I kept
thinking through use cases and I think we end up wanting this functionality
in the block layer. Let's try a story.

Stephen the PFY goes into the data centre looking to hotswap a failed
drive. Due to the eight pints of lager he had for lunch, he pulls out
the root drive instead of the failed drive. The air raid siren warbles
and he realises his mistake, shoving the drive back in.

CYOA:

Currently: All writes are lost, calamities ensue. The PFY is fired.

With dm-removable: Nobody thought to set up dm-removable on the root
drive. Calamities still ensue, but now it's the BOFH's fault instead
of the PFY's fault.

Built into the block layer: After a brief hiccup while we reattach the
drive to its block\_device, the writes resume and nobody loses their job.

What you're talking about is a deployment issue, though. Ultimately
the distribution will set up dm-removable automatically if the user
requests it, much like it sets up dm-crypt automatically for laptop
users upon request.

My concern is that not all removable devices have a globally unique id
number available in hardware so the kernel can tell whether or not
it's the same device that has been plugged in. There are hueristics
you could use -- for example, you could look at the file system uuid
plus the last fsck time. But they tend to be very file system
specific, and not things we would want ot have in the kernel.

_nod_

But in the meantime, device unplug (should give ENODEV, not EIO) is
a fatal error and we need to toss away the data.

But if it's still failing, then we should be still trying to report
the error. i.e. if fsync fails and the page remains dirty, then the
next attmept to write it is a new error and fsync should report
that. IOWs, I think we should be returning errors at every occasion
errors need to be reported if we have a persistent writeback
failure...

Which we know don't do the right thing. Seems like a lot of hoops to
jump through given it still won't work if the appliction isn't
changed to support linux specific error handling requirements...

So I agree with going to the old semantics of reporting errors from before
a file was open at least once to someone. As the PG case shows apps are
indeed relying on the old behavior. As much as it is unreliable, it ends up
doing the right thing for these apps in 99% of cases and we shouldn't break
them (BTW IMO the changelog should contain a note that this fixes a
regression of PostgreSQL, a reference to this thread and CC to stable).
Anyway feel free to add:

Oh, and to make myself clear I do think we need to find a better way of
reporting IO errors. I consider this just an immediate band-aid to avoid
userspace regressions.

So this is never going to be perfect but I think we could do good enough
by:
1) Mark inodes that hit IO error.
2) If the inode gets evicted from memory we store the fact that we hit an
error for this IO in a more space efficient data structure (sparse bitmap,
radix tree, extent tree, whatever).
3) If the underlying device gets destroyed, we can just switch the whole SB
to an error state and forget per inode info.
4) If there's too much of per-inode error info (probably per-fs configurable
limit in terms of number of inodes), we would yell in the kernel log,
switch the whole fs to the error state and forget per inode info.

This way there won't be silent loss of IO errors. Memory usage would be
reasonably limited. It could happen the whole fs would switch to error state
"prematurely" but if that's a problem for the machine, admin could tune the
limit for number of inodes to keep IO errors for...

I can see the admin wanting to rather kill the machine with OOM than having
to deal with data loss due to IO errors (e.g. if he has HA server fail over
set up). Or retry for some time before dropping the dirty data. Or do
what we do now (possibly with invalidating pages as you say). As Dave said
elsewhere there's not one strategy that's going to please everybody. So it
might be beneficial to have this configurable like XFS has it for metadata.

OTOH if I look at the problem from application developer POV, most apps
will just declare game over at the face of IO errors (if they take care to
check for them at all). And the sophisticated apps that will try some kind
of error recovery have to be prepared that the data is just gone (as
depending on what exactly the kernel does is rather fragile) so I'm not
sure how much practical value the configurable behavior on writeback errors
would bring.
